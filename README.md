# GSPNT
The Greek Study Project - New Testament

This project combines the text of the [Society of Biblical Literature's Greek New Testament](https://www.sblgnt.com/) (SBLGNT) with the morphological data from [MorphGNT](https://github.com/morphgnt) and a Greek-English lexicon into a single mobile app which will allow you to (hopefully) more easily read the Greek New Testament by quickly providing definitions and grammatical parsings for every word in the SBLGNT.

It also includes Koine Greek grammatical forms and Greek New Testament Vocabulary to help you learn and improve your Biblical Greek.

This project consists of an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database containing all the morphological and lexical data for the text of the SBLGNT, a mobile app written in [Livecode](https://livecode.com/), and a number of html files containing static information like grammer tables, instructions, etc.

If you want to try out the program, there are zip files of compiled versions for Desltop OSes in the "apps" folder.  You can install it (for Android) from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.claypotfrog.gspnt)
