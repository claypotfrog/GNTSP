These are installers for various Operating Systems.  

The Windows installers will install the software when you double click on them.  The Windows installer has an uninstaller as well which will completely remove the program from your computer.

For MacOS, double click the package to install the software into your "Application" folder.  Or unzip the .zip file and run the "Greek New Testament Study Project.app" file from where ever you like.  Everything is self-contained in the app.  To uninstall on MacOS, drag the "Greek New Testament Study Project.app" from you "Applications" directory (or where ever you put it if you used the .zip file) to the trash.  Then delete "~/.Library/Application Support/ClayPotFrog/GNTSP.db" to get ride of the database file if you so desire.  

For Linux, expand the tar.gz package and run the "install.sh" script in the folder.  On Linux, the package installs locally, into your ~/.local" directory, so run install.sh as your regular user, not as root or using sudo.  There is also an "unistall.sh" script to remove the program and all supporting files.  Agani, run as your local user.

You can get the Android and iOS versions from their respective app stores, or if you know how to side-load, the files are here.
