<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the Search icon brings you to the Search screen.  Here you can search for Greek words and for English definitions.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-screen.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>When you type in the Search bar, you can use the standard English keyboard.  The app will transliterate all you type into Greek characters.  The mapping is fairly intuitive, but you can see which English letters map to which Greek letters by pressing the dollar sign ("$") at any time.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-keyboard.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Press the spacebar or click on the keyboard map itself to turn it off.  You can type in the Search bar with the keyboard map up and the program will search like normal, but you will not be able to see what you are typing nor the results at the top of the list until you turn off the keyboard map.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you have a Greek keyboard installed on your device, you can type Greek characters directly into the Search bar.  Whichever keyboard you use, however, do not include any diacritics - no breathings, accents, diaresis, etc.  The search database does not include diacritics, so including them in your search string will result in no entries being found.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>You select which part of the database you wish to search through using the top pull-down list labeled "Search".  You have three options: "Greek Words", "Greek Forms", and "English Definitions".  "Greek Words" searches for words based on their dictionary entry.  "Greek Forms" search for words based on any of their forms found in the New Testament.  Which one you choose will depend on whether you know the dictionary entry or are searching for a form.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-word-options.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>For example, typing "ηλθον" will not turn up any entries under "Greek Words" because it is not the dictionary form of a word.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-hlthon-word.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>But switching the Search pull-down to "Greek Forms" will turn up an entry, "ἔρχομαι", because "ἦλθον" is an aorist form of the verb "ἔρχομαι".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-hlthon-form.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Below the "Search" pull-down is the "Text" pull-down.  This allows you to control where in the word you search.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-text-options.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can search for combinations of letters at the beginning a word, at the end of a word, or anywhere within that word (which includes, of course, beginning and ending).  You can also do a wildcard search which gives you complete control of what you search for in which positions.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below, we are searching for all words which begin with "βαλ".  As you can see, there are four words which begin with "βαλ" in the Greek text.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-bal-begin.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>But here we switch to "Appears Anywhere", and you can see that there are twenty-four words in the Greek text which have the letters "βαλ" anywhere in the dictionary word.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-bal-anywhere.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Finally, if we switch to "Ends With", we see that there are no words in the Greek text which end with "βαλ".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-bal-ends.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>But if you were studying the athematic "μι" verbs, you could use the "Ends With" option to discover that there are ten "ωμι" verbs in the Greek text, "δίδωμι" and nine compounds based on it.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-wmi-ends.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The final option is a wildcard search.  This gives you complete control over what you search for.  You type into the search field like normal, but use the question mark ("?") as a wildcard.  The question mark will match any characters of any length (including matching nothing).  This allows you to do much more complicated searches.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Image that we want to find all the "μι" verbs which begin with "απο".  Set the "Text" drop-down to "Wildcard Search" and then enter "απο?μι" in the search field.  This shows us that there are five verbs which begin with "απο" and end with "μι".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-wildcard.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can use as many wildcards as you like.  In the image below we are searching for all words which begin with "β" and are followed by an "α" and then a "λ" with anything (including nothing) in-between.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-wildcard-multiple.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>(Please note that the dollar sign only matches when you select "Wildcard Search".  If you switch to "Begins With", etc. then any wildcards will be removed from your search string.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Up until now, all of our results have been sorted alphabetically by the Greek word.  This is indicated by the blue Sort icon in the upper right which is labeled "A" to "Z".  But if you click on the Sort icon, you have four possible options for sorting your results: alphabetically by the Greek word either ascending (A-Z) or descending (Z-A), or numerically by the number of times the word appears in the Greek New Testament (count), again either ascending (1-9) or descending (9-1).</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-show-sort.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on any of these lines will immediately resort your results.  So in the image below, we have resorted the same "ωμι" results to show them alphabetically descending, from "Z" to "A" (or rather "Ω" to "Α" in Greek).</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-sort-Z-A.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>And here, we have resorted the same results to show them by "Count Descending" so that the words are displayed by their frequency in the text.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-sort-9-1.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can also search in the definitions of words by selecting "English Definitions" from the Search drop-down.  The Text drop-down will switch to "Appears Anywhere" since that is the only way you can search the English definitions.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-english.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Here we are searching for all Greek words which have "encourage" in their glosses.  You can see that there are five words which contain the word "encourage". <i>(Note this also finds "encouragement" because it includes the text "encourage".)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-english-encourage.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Regardless of what you are searching for, clicking on any of these lines will bring that Greek word up in the Details screen, just the same as if you have clicked on the word while reading the Greek text.  In addition, pressing the RETURN or ENTER key on your keyboard at this point will automatically select the first word on the list and go the Details screen for that word.  Here we have pressed RETURN (or clicked on the first entry - "παράκλησις") and have gone to its Details screen.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-encourage.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>Please see the <b>Details</b> section below for more information about the Details screen</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you are on a Mobile OS, then the mobile keyboard will appear every time you enter the Search screen.  If you have hidden the mobile keyboard and want it to reappear, simply click on the search field.</p>
