<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the Search icon brings you to the Search screen.  Here you can search for Greek words and for English definitions.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-screen.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>When you type in the Search bar, you can use the standard keyboard.  The app will transliterate all you type into Greek characters.  The mapping is fairly intuitive, but you can see which English letters map to which Greek letters by pressing the dollar sign ("$") at any time.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-keyboard.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Press the spacebar or click on the keyboard map itself to turn it off.  You can type in the Search bar with the keyboard map up and the program will search like normal, but you will not be able to see what you are typing nor the results at the top of the list until you turn off the keyboard map.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you have a Greek keyboard installed on your device, you can type Greek characters directly into the Search bar.  Whichever keyboard you use, however, do not include any diacritics - no breathings, accents, diaresis, etc.  The search database does not include diacritics, so including them in your search string will result in no entries being found.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>You select which part of the database you wish to search through using the top pull-down list labeled "Search".  You have three options: "Greek Words", "Greek Forms", and "English Definitions".  "Greek Words" searches for words based on their dictionary entry.  "Greek Forms" search for words based on any of their forms found in the New Testament.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-word-options.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>For example, typing "ηλθον" will not turn up any entries under "Greek Words" because it is not the dictionary form of a word.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-hlthon-word.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>But switching the Search pull-down to "Greek Forms" will turn up an entry, "ἔρχομαι", because "ἦλθον" is an aorist form of the verb "ἔρχομαι".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-hlthon-form.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Below the "Search" pull-down is the "Text" pull-down.  This allows you to control where in the word you search.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-text-options.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can search for combinations of letters at the beginning a word, at the end of a word, or anywhere within that word (which includes, of course, beginning and ending).  You can also do a wildcard search which gives you complete control of what you search for in which positions.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below, we are searching for all words which begin with "βαλ".  As you can see, there are four words which begin with "βαλ" in the Greek text.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-bal-begin.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>But here we switch to "Appears Anywhere", and you can see that there are twenty-four words in the Greek text which have the letters "βαλ" anywhere in the dictionary word.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-bal-anywhere.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Finally, if we switch to "Ends With", we see that there are no words in the Greek text which end with "βαλ".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-bal-ends.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>But if you were studying the athematic "μι" verbs, you could use the "Ends With" option to discover that there are ten "ωμι" verbs in the Greek text, "δίδωμι" and nine compounds based on it.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-wmi-ends.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The final option is a wildcard search.  This gives you complete control over what you search for.  You type into the search field like normal, but there are additional "special" characters you can use.  First is the question mark ("?") which acts as a wildcard.  The question mark will match any characters of any length (including matching nothing).  This allows you to do much more complicated searches.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Image that we want to find all the "μι" verbs which begin with the prefix "απο".  (We'll just use "απ" in our search since the "ο" disappears before vowels.)  Set the "Text" drop-down to "Wildcard Search" and then enter "απ?μι" in the search field.  This shows us that there are seven verbs which begin with "απ" and end with "μι".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-wildcard.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>But we also know that the "π" in "απo" becomes a "φ" before an aspirated vowel (a vowel with a rough breathing).  Our present search doesn't catch words that begin with "αφ".  We could search for "α?μι", but that will show us words which do not begin with "απ" or "αφ" like "ἀνίημι".</p>
<p spacebelow=10>What we want to is search for words which begin EITHER with "απ" or "αφ".  For that we use the brackets "[]".  All characters enclosed in brackets will be searched for one at a time keeping the rest of the search string the same.  So if we type "α[πφ]" we mean that we want to search for either "απ" or "αφ".</p>
<p spacebelow=10>So in our search field this time, we'll change our previous search of "απ?μι" to "α[πφ]?μι".  Now we've told the program to search for "απ?μι" and "αφ?μι".  This shows us nine matches, the seven words that began with "απ" and now two extra that begin with "αφ".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-wildcard-bracket.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can only use brackets once in a wildcard search.  You cannot enter something like "α[πφ]?[ηι]μι".  That search will return nothing.  But you can include as many question marks as you like.  In the image below we are searching for all words which begin with "β" and are followed by an "α" and then a "λ" with anything (including nothing) in-between.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-wildcard-multiple.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>(The question mark and brackets can only be used when you select "Wildcard Search".  They are automatically removed from any other type of search.)</i></p>
<h3>Sorting</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Up until now, all of our results have been sorted alphabetically by the Greek word.  This is indicated by the blue Sort icon in the upper right which is labeled "A" to "Ω".  But if you click on the Sort icon, you have four possible options for sorting your results: alphabetically by the Greek word either ascending (A-Ω) or descending (Ω-A), or numerically by the number of times the word appears in the Greek New Testament (count), again either ascending (1-9) or descending (9-1).</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-show-sort.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on any of these lines will immediately resort your results.  So in the image below, we have resorted the same "ωμι" results to show them alphabetically descending, from "Ω" to "A".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-sort-Z-A.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>And here, we have resorted the same results to show them by "Count Descending" so that the words are displayed by their frequency in the text.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-sort-9-1.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can also search in the definitions of words by selecting "English Definitions" from the Search drop-down.  The Text drop-down will switch to "Appears Anywhere" since that is the only way you can search the English definitions.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-english.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Here we are searching for all Greek words which have "encourage" in their glosses.  You can see that there are five words which contain the word "encourage". <i>(Note this also finds "encouragement" because it includes the text "encourage".)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-english-encourage.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Regardless of what you searched for, clicking on any of these lines will either take you to the Details screen for this word or add this word (or all the words in the list) to a vocabulary list.  Directly above the list of words, on the right, below the "Cancel" button, the program tells you what action a click will do.  By default, when you enter the Search screen, it says "Open in Details".  This means that when you click on any of these lines, it will bring that Greek word up in the Details screen, just the same as if you have clicked on the word while reading the Greek text.  In the screen below, we have clicked on the first line, "παράκλησις", which takes us to its Details screen.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-encourage.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>Please see the <b>Details</b> section below for more information about the Details screen</i></p>
<h3>Searching for Multiple Words in a Verse</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Until now, all our searches are for a single Greek word.  But you can also search for verses which have two words in them.  Let's use this function to find all the verses which have both "πατήρ" (father) and "υἱός" (son), them.  You access this function by clicking anywhere on the line where it says, "Open in Details".  This gives you a list of options for what happens when you click on a word in the search results.  Up until now clicking on a word did exactly what that line says, it opened that word in the Details page.  But if you click on that line you will see that you have some other options.  In this case, choose the line which says "Multi-Word Search".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-menu-multi-word.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The line which used to say "Open in Details" now says "Multi-Word Search".  We'll start typing in the search field like normal, typing "πατηρ".  When the word we want appears in our search results, we click on it like normal.  This time, however, the program does not take us to the Details page for this word. Instead, this word is "locked" in the search field, and we have another search field where we can search for a second word.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-first-word.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now we start typing our second word, in this case "υιος".  (We don't have to type much.  Not many words in the New Testament begin with "υι".)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-second-word.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>This time when you click the word in our search results, since you have already set the first word, you will be taken to a list of all the verses that have both these words (in any form) in them.  As you can see, there are 45 verses which have both the words.  (The two words you searched for are listed at the top of the page.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-multiple-results.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Just like any list of verses, you can click on them to expand them and see the Greek text.  The two words which you selected will both be highlighted.  In the image below we have opened the first verse, Matthew 5:45, and are also showing the English translation as well.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-multiple-results-expanded.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Just like in any list of verses, you can click and hold an expanded verse to collapse it, or you can click on an expanded verse to open that verse within its book.  When you do so, every form of both words you searched for will be highlighted in the book.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below, we have clicked on the first verse in the list, Matthew 5:45, and the program has opened the book of Matthew, and taken us that verse.  The words "πατηρ" and "υἱός" have been highlighted wherever they appear in the book.  <i>(Please note searching for two words will increase the time it takes to open the verse you clicked since the whole book must now be searched for every instance of two words rather than one.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-hilite-two-words.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If no verse in the Greek New Testament contains both these words, then the program will flash the message "No Matches".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-multiple-results-nomatches.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can choose a different word from your search results or type a different second word.  If you wish to change the first word you selected, then click the word "Cancel" and everything you have entered will be removed, and you can start typing the first word again.</p>
<h3>Adding Words to Vocabulary Lists</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>You can also use the search function to put words into a Vocabulary group.  Imagine that we want to create a Vocabulary List of those same "ωμι" verbs we found before.  There are two ways to accomplish this.  We can add words directly to an existing group, or we can add all the words to the Vocabulary Creator page and then use them to create a new vocabulary group.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>First let's make a new vocabulary list and then group that we will use to study these words.  On the main vocabulary page, create a new vocabulary list called "MI Verbs".  Click the blue "Edit" link to put the page into EDIT mode, then click the blue "+" ("plus") in the upper left and choose "Create New List".  In the dialog box that appears, enter "MI Verbs" and press the "Create" button.  Finally press the blue "Done" link in the upper right to take the page out of EDIT mode.  Now we have a new vocabulary list called "MI Verbs".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-add-new-list.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click on that line, "MI Verbs", to view the vocabulary groups.  This page is empty, of course, since it's a new list.  Let's create a new empty group in our new empty list.  Just like on the main Vocabulary page, click the "Edit" link, then click the blue "+" that appears in the upper left, and choose "Create New Group" from the drop-down menu that appears.  This takes us to the Vocabulary Creator page.  Immediately click the "Save" link in the upper right.  When the program asks you if you'd like to create an empty group, choose "Yes".  Now we are returned to the vocabulary groups page and we have a new empty group at the top.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-add-empty-group.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click on "Edit" again and then click the "New Empty Group" line to rename it.  Call it "WMI Verbs".  Click the "Rename" button, and then click the "Done" link in the upper right.  Now we have an empty group called "WMI Verbs".  (See the section "Creating Vocabulary" on the About page for more detailed instructions on creating new lists and groups.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-add-new-group.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now click the blue star outline on the right side of the "WMI Verbs" line.  The star will become solid.  This means that we can now add words directly to this vocabulary group.  (See the section "Editing Vocabulary" on the About page for more information on starring groups so you can add words directly to them.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-add-starred.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Go back to the Search page.  Redo the search for "ωμι" verbs if you need to.  Once you've done the search, click anywhere on the line where it says, "Open in Details" and it will present you with a list of options for what happens when you click on a word in the search results.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-show-options.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>In this case we will choose the bottom option, "Add All Words to Vocabulary", because we want to do exactly that - add all the words.  But you could also choose "Add Word to Vocabulary" and then whichever line you clicked on, that word would be added rather than all the words in the list.  The line above the search results will show you that you have chosen this option.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>Please note that this option always resets to "Open in Details" every time you enter the Search page.  So if you exit this page and then return to it, your search results will still be there, but you'll need to choose again what happened when you click on a line if you don't want to go to the details page of that word.</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now when you click on any word in the list, instead of the going to "Details" page for that word, you will see a drop-down menu where you choose which vocabulary lists to add these words to.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-add-dropdown.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The first line always says, "Vocabulary Creator Field".  We can place the words there and deal with them later if we like.  (See below.)  But all the other lines are vocabulary groups you have "starred" so that you can add words directly to them.  In this case we see the "WMI Verbs" group we just created, and another group we have also starred labeled "My Custom Group".  Choose the "WMI Verbs" line, and the program will add <b>all</b> the words to that vocabulary group.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-word-added.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>We can confirm this by going back to the main Vocabulary page and clicking on the "MI Verbs" line to view the vocabulary groups in this list.  Here we see that the "WMI Verbs" group now has 10 words in it as seen by the line "Examine 10 words".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-add-group-filled.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>As noted above, if we have not starred a group to add the words to, we can put them into the "Manual List" field on the Vocabulary Creator page.  Now when you go create a new Vocabulary Group (or edit an existing one), you'll see all the words you added in the "Manual List" item.  (They are added in the same order they appeared on the Search screen.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-words-in-field.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>When you click the "Add Words" link, the program will look them up in the dictionary and place them in the vocabulary list below.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/search-words-in-list.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now you can save them into an existing vocabulary group or use them to make a new one.  (See the sections on "Creating Vocabulary" and "Editing Vocabulary" on the About page for more detailed instructions on creating new groups and editing existing ones.)</p>
