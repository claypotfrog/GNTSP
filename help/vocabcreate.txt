<h3>Creating New Vocabulary Lists</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>There are two ways to create a new vocabulary list: manually or by importing a list that someone else has shared.  Here we will show how to create a new list yourself.  See the section "Sharing Vocabulary" on the About page in order to see how to import a list that someone else has shared with you.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>To create a new vocabulary list, first you must make a new empty list.  On the vocabulary page, click the "Edit" link in the upper right to put the page into EDIT mode. Then click on the blue plus sign ("+") which appears in the upper left to create a new list.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-create.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Choose "Create New List", and then enter a name for the new list in the dialog box which appears.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-new.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The new list will be added to the top of the vocabulary lists, but you can reorder it at any time by dragging its reorder bars into a new position.  Here we have just created a new vocabulary list called "Mark".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-new-mark.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click the "Done" link in the upper right to take the vocab screen out of EDIT mode.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-new-normal.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now click on the vocabulary list you just created to go to the Vocabulary groups for that list.  Since this is a brand new list and we have not created any groups, the list is empty.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-empty.png"></p>
<h3>Creating Vocabulary Groups in a List</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Like with vocabulary lists, you can create vocabulary groups in two way: manually or by importing a vocabulary group which has been shared with you.  Here we will look here at how to create new groups manually.  Click on the "Edit" link in the upper right to put the page into EDIT mode.  Then click the blue plus sign ("+") in the upper left.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-menu.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Choose "Create New Group", and you will go the Vocabulary Group Creator page.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-creator.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>There are (again!) two ways on this page to create vocabulary group.  You can select words en masse by frequency or you can enter individual words.</p>
<h3>Create Vocabulary Groups by Frequency</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>To create a new group based on word frequency, select the "Frequency List" button near the top of the screen. <i>(This is the default choice when you create a new list.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click where it says "All Books" in blue below the title "Select words from:".  Here we choose which books of the Bible we want to select words from.  We can select words from "All Books" (the entire Greek New Testament), or we can select words from any individual book.  In this example we want to make vocabulary groups from the words in the book of Mark, so we choose "Mark" from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-bookmenu.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you choose a book, then you can also choose to select words from the entire book or from only one chapter.  Click on the word "All" in blue below the heading labeled "Chapter:".  This brings up the chapter menu.  You can select "All" for the entire book (the default) or choose a particular chapter.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-chpmenu.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Then from the drop-down menu labeled "Word types:" we choose which types of words we want to select.  We can choose "All Words", or we can limit our selection to only verbs, only nouns, only adjectives, or only "miscellaneous" (which is everything other than verbs, nouns, and adjectives).</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-typemenu.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Next we choose the frequency of words which we want to select.  We can set a minimum frequency and a maximum frequency for how often a word appears in what we have selected. Click on either the blue "1" or the blue "All" below the "Minimum" and Maximum" labels to bring up the sliders.  (<i>Clicking on either brings up the same two sliders.</i>)</p> 
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-sliders.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can adjust the slider by clicking and dragging them.  You can also click and hold on the slider above or below the slider bar to move quickly through the values.  Finally, you can click and hold on the labels, "Minimum" and "Maximum", or the actual values (in this case "1" and "All") to move slowly up or down.  Adjust the sliders to choose how often a word must appear in the selection to be included in this group and click "OK" when you are done.  You'll see that the Minimum and Maximum columns now they the range that you just selected. (<i>The sliders are "inclusive", so if you chose 10 to 12, then you will see all words which appear 10, 11 or 12 times in the selection.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In this case, we'll leave the sliders at "1" and "All".  So our settings are Book: Mark, Chapter: 1, Words: All Words, Frequency in Selection: 1 to All. Now click the blue link which says "Create List" and the program will pull out every word which appears in Mark chapter 1
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-mark-1.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>As you can see, there 239 unique words which appear Mark chapter 1.  By default, the list of words is in Alphabetical order, but you can change that by clicking on the line which says "Sort Results by:"  Let's change the sort order to "Count descending" which means we will see the words in order from most to least common.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-sort.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now we see that there are still 239 words, and the most common word is the definite article, followed by conjunction καί, followed by the pronoun αὐτός, and so on.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-sorted-count.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Below the line labeled "Frequency in Selection", there's a checkbox which says "Frequency in all books".  At present it is not checked, so there's no numbers under the Minimum and Maximum columns.  But if we check that box, those columns will become a range we can click like we can "Frequency in Selection".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-allbooks.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>We use this range to limit the words which are chosen by the Frequency in Selection range.  Imagine that we already know our Greek vocabulary down to every word which appears 10 times or more in the New Testament.  In that case, many of the words in our Mark 1 list will be words we already know.  We could lower our Frequency in Selection to 1 to 9, but there will certainly be words which appear only 1 time in Mark 1, but which appear many more times in other places.  We want to select all the words in Mark 1 which do not appear <i>anywhere</i> in the Greek New Testament 10 or more times.  That's what this range allows us to do.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>So let's leave our "Frequency in Selection" range at 1 to All, but let's click on the "1" or "All" next to "Frequency in All Books" and use the sliders to change that range to 1 to 9.  (We could also change our Frequency in Selection to 1 to 9, since there certainly won't be more occurrences of any word in Mark than in the whole Greek NT.  But leaving it as 1 to All won't change anything.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-sliders-1-9.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now when we click "Create List", we see that there are 41 words in Mark 1 which appears less than 10 times anywhere in the Greek New Testament.  And 40 of them appear only 1 time in this chapter.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-less-than-10.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If we are not happy with this list, we can reset our parameters and click the "Create List" item again.  Or we can remove words from this list by scrolling to the words we want to remove and clicking on the red trash icon to delete them.  Additionally we can add individual words to this list of words, either now or later after we have created it, using the "Manual List" control above.  (See the section "Editing Vocabulary" on the About page.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>If we are happy with our list, then let's save it as a vocabulary group (or groups) so we can study these words.  Click the blue "Save" link in the upper right to bring up the Save dialog box.</p> 
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-save-dialog.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>First we must give the group a name.  We'll call this "Mark 1".  Then below where we enter the name, it asks you how many words to put in each group.  By default it will create 1 group with all the words from your list.  But if your list had hundreds (or thousands) of words, that could be far too large a group of words to study at one time.  Use the slider to tell the program what's the most words you want in any vocabulary group.  Since there are 41 words in this group, I can have from 1 to 41 groups - 1 group of 41 words, or 41 groups of 1 word.  In this case, let's create 2 groups, one will have 20 words and the other will have 21.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-save-groups.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you do want to create more than 1 group, you'll need to tell the program how to split the words up.  Click next to the label "Split Groups by:" where it says "Click here" in blue.  This allows you to split the words into group alphabetically up or down, by count (how often the word appears in the selection) up or down, or randomly.  We'll choose randomly.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-sortby.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have everything set the way you want, click the "Create" button, and the program will create the groups, place them on the Vocabulary Groups page, and take us back to that page. So here we see the two groups we created from the words in Mark 1.  Notice that the program has taken the name we gave it, "Mark 1", and appended "-01" and "-02" to distinguish the two groups.  But we can change the names of the groups to whatever we want.  (See the section on "Editing Vocabulary" in the About page for information on how to edit the names of lists and groups.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-mark1.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>There is one other Save option that can be helpful here.  If you choose words from "All" chapters of a book, then when you go to save the groups, the checkbox under the Name field becomes active.  This allows you to create groups for every chapter in the book without having to create a group for each chapter manually.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Let's do this whole process again to demonstrate this.  Here on the Vocabulary Groups page, click "Edit", then click the "+" ("plus") in the upper left, then choose "Create New Group" from the menu which appears.  This takes us back to the Vocabulary Groups Creator page.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>On that page we select Mark, but this time we select "All" chapters instead of a specific chapter.  We select "All Words", and we  set the "Frequency in Selection" to 1 to All and the "Frequency in All Books" to 1 to 9.  So our screen looks like this:</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-mark-all.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click the "Create List" link, and we see that there are 549 words in the entire book of Mark which appear less than 10 times in the entire Greek New Testament.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-mark-total.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now when we click the "Save" link and go to the Save dialog, we see that the checkbox "Create groups by chapters" is active and can be checked.  (It was not active when we saved words from a single chapter.)  Check that box, and you will see that the name is filled in for you as the name of the book (you cannot edit this name), and the slider below changes.  Previously the default was to create one big group with all the words.  But now the program is going to automatically create a group of words for each chapter.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Since Mark has 16 chapters, the program is going to create 16 groups.  We need to tell it whether we want those groups to have a maximum number of words.  The default is to create a single group for each chapter.  So if there are 12 words in a chapter, that group will have 12 words in it.  If there are 100 words in a chapter, that group will have 100 words in it.  But you can use this slider to limit how big a group can be.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you do choose the limit how many words can appear in a group, then like before, you'll need to tell the program how to split the words into group by clicking on the "Split Groups by" item.  In this case, we will leave the default of one group per chapter.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now when you click the "Create" button, the program will go through the list of words and pull out all the words which are found in chapter 1 of Mark and put them in a group.  Then it will go through all the words in chapter 2 which do not appear in chapter 1 and put them in a group.  So the chapter 2 group will not have any duplicate words from chapter 1.  Then it will go through the list and pull out all the words which appear in chapter 3 but not in chapters 1 or 2 and put them into a group.  It will do this all the way through the entire book.  So all the words in your list will be placed in a group for the chapter that word first appears in.  But no word will ever appear twice even if it appears in multiple chapters.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Because the program has to make multiple passes through the list pulling out the words for that chapter, it takes much longer to create these groups.  But the program will show you which chapter it is working on so you can see its progress.  Then when it is done, it will take you back to the Vocabulary Groups page and show you the groups it created.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-mark-all-chp.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>As you can see, the program has created one group for each chapter in Mark.  The first group has 41 words, but the next two only have 23, which chapter 4 has 36, and so on.  If you add up the totals of the number of words in each chapter, it will equal 549 because there were 549 words in the list we created of word in Mark which appear less than 10 times in the entire Greek New Testament.</p>
<h3>Creating Empty Vocabulary Groups</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>You may wish to create empty vocabulary groups in order to add words to them later.  (See the section on "Editing Vocabulary" on the About page.)  To do this, follow the same steps to create a new group.  When you are on the Vocabulary Creator page, however, do not create a list or add any words.  Simply click the "Save" button in the upper right.  The program will prompt you if you wish to create an empty group.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-create-empty.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click "Yes" and you will be taken back to the Vocabulary Groups page where you will see a new first group named "New Empty Group" which has 0 words in it.  You can rename the group to whatever you like by clicking on the "Edit" link in the upper right and then clicking on this group.  You can also move it to any other position on the list.  (See the section on "Editing Vocabulary" on the About page.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-empty-created.png"></p>
<h3>Creating Vocabulary Groups Manually</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>You can create a list of any words you wish, or add words to any frequency list you have created, by clicking on the "Manual List" at the top of the page.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-mark-manual.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Please see the section on "Editing Vocabulary" on the About page for instructions how to use the manual creation field.</p>
