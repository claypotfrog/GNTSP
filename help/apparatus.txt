<p spacebelow=10>The SBLGNT Textual Apparatus is now included along with the text of the Greek New Testament.  By default, however, it is not enabled.  You can enable the Textual Apparatus in the Settings dialog box of the Read page.  Click on the blue gear icon in the upper right corner of the Read page to bring up the Settings Dialog box.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/fontsettings.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Then click on the checkbox near the bottom of the box which says "Show Textual Apparatus".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/textual_app_settings.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click the "Done" button and the Textual Apparatus will be loaded for whichever book you are presently reading.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>When the Textual Apparatus is enabled, a small Greek papyrus icon will appear at the end of any verse in the Greek text which contains information in the Textual Apparatus.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below, we have enabled the Textual Apparatus for the book of Galatians.  You can see the window at the bottom of the screen where the Textual Apparatus for a verse will be displayed.  In addition, you can see two papyrus icons here in Galatians 1, one at the end of verse 3 and one at the end of verse 4.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/textual_app_initial.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>(Please note that the Textual Apparatus can only be enabled and disabled while reading the Greek text.  Since there is no apparatus for the English text, the button is disabled and you cannot click on it if you access the Settings while reading the English text.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If we click on the papyrus icon at the end of verse 3, then we will see the Textual Apparatus information for that verse in a blue box directly below the papyrus icon we clicked on.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/textual_app_after_click.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The program will always attempt to place the textual apparatus directly below the icon so you can see the verse itself while you read the apparatus.  But if there is not enough room below the icon, then the apparatus will be displayed at the top of the Greek text.  If you wish to see the apparatus below the verse then, if possible, scroll down a bit to make space on the screen below the verse.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below, we have clicked on the apparatus icon at the end of the last verse in the book of Romans, 16:24.  Obviously there's no way to scroll any further down, so the apparatus is displayed at the top of the text.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/textual_app_long.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The Textual Apparatus presents the information in a very specific format using a series of symbols and abbreviations.  If you would like to learn how to read the Apparatus, or you simply want more information about the SBLGNT Textual Apparatus, read the <a href="https://www.sblgnt.com/about/introduction/">Introduction to the SBLGNT</a> found on the SBLGNT website.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have enabled the Textual Apparatus, it will remain enabled for any book you read.  Moreover, the program remembers your choice between sessions.  So if you enable the Textual Apparatus and then quit the program, it will still be enabled when you restart.  You must go back to the Settings Dialog box and "uncheck" the checkbox to disable the Textual Apparatus.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Enabling the Textual Apparatus will also significantly increase the time it takes to load a book.  On a modern device, this is still not a long time, but it will be noticeable.  To load the book of Acts without the Textual Apparatus on my iPhone 12 is instantaneous.  To load it with the Textual Apparatus takes almost four seconds.  Not "sorry I missed the meeting; I was waiting for the Apparatus to load" late, but still, definitely noticeable.  If you have an older, slower device, I advise that you leave the Textual Apparatus off unless you want to look at something specifically.</p>
