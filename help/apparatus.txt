<p spacebelow=10>The SBLGNT Textual Apparatus is now included along with the text of the Greek New Testament.  By default, however, it is not enabled.  You can enable the Textual Apparatus in the Settings dialog box of the Read page.  Click on the blue gear icon in the upper right corner of the Read page to bring up the Settings Dialog box.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/fontsettings.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Then click on the checkbox near the bottom of the box which says "Show Textual Apparatus".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/textual_app_settings.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click the "Done" button and the Textual Apparatus will be loaded for whichever book you are presently reading.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>When the Textual Apparatus is enabled, a small window will open at the bottom of your screen.  This is where the text of the Textual Apparatus for any verse will appear.  And in the Greek text itself, a small Greek papyrus icon will appear at the end of any verse which contains information in the Textual Apparatus.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below, we have enabled the Textual Apparatus for the book of Galatians.  You can see the window at the bottom of the screen where the Textual Apparatus for a verse will be displayed.  In addition, you can see two papyrus icons here in Galatians 1, one at the end of verse 3 and one at the end of verse 4.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/textual_app_initial.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If we click on the papyrus icon at the end of verse 3, then we will see the Textual Apparatus information for that verse in the box at the bottom of the screen.  <i>(That window can be scrolled separately from the main window if necessary to view all the Apparatus information.)</i></p>

<p spacebelow=10>The Textual Apparatus presents the information in a very specific format using a series of symbols and abbreviations.  If you would like to learn how to read the Apparatus, or you simply want more information about the SBLGNT Textual Apparatus, read the <a href="https://www.sblgnt.com/about/introduction/">Introduction to the SBLGNT</a> found on the SBLGNT website.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have enabled the Textual Apparatus, it will remain enabled for any book you read.  Moreover, the program remembers your choice between sessions.  So if you enable the Textual Apparatus and then quit the program, it will still be enabled when you restart.  You must go back to the Settings Dialog box and "uncheck" the checkbox to disable the Textual Apparatus.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Enabling the Textual Apparatus will also significantly increase the time it takes to load a book.  On a modern device, this is still not a long time, but it will be noticeable.  To load the book of Acts without the Textual Apparatus on my iPhone 12 is instantaneous.  To load it with the Textual Apparatus takes almost four seconds.  Not "sorry I missed the meeting; I was waiting for the Apparatus to load" late, but still, definitely noticeable.  If you have an older, slower device, I advise that you leave the Textual Apparatus off unless you want to look at something specifically.</p>
