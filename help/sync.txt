<p spacebelow=10>On the bottom of the Vocabulary page, you'll see the "Backup/Synchronize" panel above the Navigation bar.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-disabled.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>This panel allows you to backup your data to a server on the internet.  You can use that backup both to download your data if you have to reinstall the program, but also to synchronize your data between separate devices.  So if you want to use this app both on your phone and your desktop, or on your phone and your tablet (or on any number of devices of any type), you can keep your data in sync.  You can work on vocabulary on one device, backup your data, then download that data to another device, and pick up your study where you left off on the previous device.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>The "Backup/Synchronize" panel is disabled (grayed out) at first because your device is not connected to an account on the backup server.  Click on the blue gear icon in the lower right to bring up the "Account Setup" dialog where you can setup a backup account.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-setup.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If this is your first (or only) device, then click the "Create Account" button.  A new account will be created on the server with a random Account ID and Password, and your data will be automatically copied to this account.  You will then be asked if you want to automatically sync your account before and after you study vocabulary.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-new-account.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you press "Yes", then every time you click the "Study" button to study vocabulary and every time you exit a vocabulary study session, the program will automatically sync your account.  Press "No" if you prefer to sync your account yourself.  "Ask" will ask you every time you start and every time you finish a vocabulary study session if you wish to sync your account.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you create a new account, you can find your Account ID and Password by clicking again on the blue gear icon in the lower right.  This will now bring up the "Account Information" dialog box.  You should store your Account ID and Password (take a screenshot and email it to yourself) so you can retrieve your backup in case you need to reinstall the program or you wish to access the data on a different device.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-account-info.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Account IDs are random numbers between 1000 and 1000000.  Passwords are 10 <b>hexadecimal</b> characters long. ("Hexadecimal" means they consist only of the numbers 0-9 and the letters 'A-F'.  So when you see an "0", that's the number zero not the letter Oh.) You cannot change either of these.  They are created by the program.</p>
<p>Once you know your Account ID and Password, you can connect additional devices to this account by entering the Account ID and Password into the "Connect to Existing Account" section of the New Account dialog on the other devices and clicking the "Connect" button.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-connect-account.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Assuming that you have entered the correct Account ID and Password, your device will be connected to this account, and you will be given the choice whether to copy the data from this account to your local device immediately.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-verified.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you choose to copy your data, after the sync, you will be asked if you want to automatically sync your data before and after every vocabluary study session.  <i>(See the comments above on answering this question after creating a new account.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-auto-ask.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can change the automatic sync function any time by clicking on the blue gear icon in the lower right to bring up the "Account Information" dialog box.  Above the Close button is a line that says "Automatically sync database before and after studying vocabluary?"  Next to it is a blue line which says "Yes", "No", or "Ask".  Click on that word to bring up the menu where you change whether the program automatically syncs before and after studying vocabulary.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-auto-choose.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have either created a new account or connected to an existing account, the "Backup/Synchronize" panel will become active and you can click on it.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-active.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Unless you tell the program to automatically synchronize your device, backing up and synchronizing must always be done manually.  You must press the "Backup/Synchronize" button to initiate copying the data.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>The program will keep track of which copy of the data is newer, your local copy or the copy on the server.  When you backup/synchronize, the program will compare the data and decide whether to copy your local data to the server or copy the server's data to your local device.  You do not need to keep track of which copy is the most recent. <i>(If you are only using one device, then the program will always copy your local data to the server.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>It is possible, however, if you are syncing your account between multiple devices, that your data can get out of sync.  For example, if you make changes on one device without first pressing "Backup/Synchronize" to make sure that you have the most recent copy of your data, then when you go to backup your data on this device, the program will not know which way to copy the data because the server has data that your local copy does not have, and your local copy has data that the server does not have.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In that case, the program will present you with a dialog box so that you can decide which direction to copy your data.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-conflict.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you are using the program on multiple devices, then you should always synchronize your data on each device BEFORE you make any changes (before you study Vocabulary or make any changes to words on the "Details" screen), and then synchronize again AFTER you have made any changes.  In this way, your devices will always be in sync.  The automatic sync function can do that for you before and after studying vocabulary, but you must do it manually if you make changes to any words on the "Details" screen.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you ever make changes on your local device but do NOT want to save those changes to the server, or if you want to copy your data up to the server even though you know that the server data is newer, then you can tell the program to ask you whether to upload or download your data next time you backup.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click the blue gear icon in the lower right to bring up the "Account Information" dialog box and check the small box below the Close button which says, "Choose Direction Of Sync Next Backup".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-force-manual.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Then press "Close" to exit the dialog box.  Next time you click the "Backup/Synchronize" button, the program will tell you that your data is out of sync and show you the dialog box which allows you to choose which direction to copy your data.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can disconnect from your account at any time by clicking on the "Disconnect" button in the "Account Information" dialog box.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-account-info.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You must then tell the program whether it can delete your backup files or not.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-confirm-delete.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you have other devices using this data, then tell the program to "Keep" your files.  But if you no longer need the data, please allow the program to "Delete" your files so that they do not take up space on the backup server.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Obviously to connect to a server on the internet, you will need an internet connection.  By default, the program will try for 20 seconds to access the backup server.  If it cannot reach the server after 20 seconds, it will stop trying and alert you so you can check your internet connection and try again later.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you need to increase how long the program tries to connect to the server, however, you can adjust it by clicking on the blue gear icon in the lower right next to the "Backup/Synchronize" button.  In either the "Account Setup" dialog or the "Account Information" dialog, just above the "Close" button, you'll see a line that says "Try to connect to the server for:"</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-timeout-20.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click on the menu which says "20 seconds" and you can increase the time up to 5 minutes (300 seconds).</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/sync-timeout-60.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>That change will be saved so that the program will always try to connect to the server for that long until you change.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>This is obviously a very rudimentary backup and synchronization system.  You can't chose your own Account Name or Password, you can't decide what data to backup, everything is done manually, and you can't do any sort of "Merge" if your devices get out of sync.  While there is a lot of room for improvement to this system (and one day I hope go back and do just that), for the moment, it does a <i>decent</i> enough job of backing up your data and keeping multiple devices in sync.</p>
