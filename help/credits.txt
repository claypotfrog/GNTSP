<p spacebelow=10>The Greek New Testament Study App was inspired by the outstanding <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/greekkit/id919649936">GreekKit</a> app by Casey Perkins.  It is the app that I used to read the New Testament in Greek for many years.  Unfortunately it is only available on iOS.  This program began as my poor attempt to replicate in Android what I considered to be GreekKit's most outstanding features of reading and searching the Greek New Testament.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>But as so often happens in programming projects, feature creep began to set in.  We haven't quite reached <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Z/Zawinskis-Law.html">Zawinski's Law</a>, but it can't be long.  Since I wrote this in LiveCode, which can cross-compile, I decided to make desktop versions and an iOS version.  And then I decided to include things that I wish that I'd had when I was first studying Greek.  So there is reference section of Greek grammatical forms, Verb and Noun Form Reviews to practice recognizing verb and noun forms, and a Vocabulary tutor.  (This Vocabulary tutor is based on the <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> flashcard app.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>The Greek text of the New Testament used in this app is the <a href="https://www.sblgnt.com/">SBL Greek New Testament</a> produced by the <a href="https://www.sbl-site.org/">Society of Biblical Literature</a> and <a href="https://www.logos.com/">Logos Bible Software</a>.  The entire New Testament academic community is deeply in their debt both for the work that it took to produce this edition as well as their decision to make it freely available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons License</a>.  I obtained the text from their <a href="https://github.com/LogosBible/SBLGNT">GitHub project</a>.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>The English translation of the New Testament used in this app is the <a href="http://www.lexhamenglishbible.com">Lexham English Bible</a>, also produced by <a href="https://www.logos.com/">Logos Bible Software</a> and made available by them freely for non-Commercial works.  You can find their (very generous) licensing requirements <a href="https://lexhampress.com/LEB-License">here</a>.  I obtained a copy of their work from this <a href="https://github.com/aaronshaf/lexham-english-bible">GitHub project</a>.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>The dictionary definitions used in this app come primarily from John Jeffrey Dodson's lexicon which he prepared as part of his book <i>The Greek New Testament for Beginning Readers : The Byzantine Greek Text</i> and then placed in the public domain.  The copyright notice for his lexicon reads as follows:</p>

<p spacebelow=10>In places where (I felt) Dodson's lexicon did not include adequate definitions for words found in the SBLGNT, glosses were obtained from the Perseus' Project Digital Library of Tufts University.

<p spacebelow=10>The Lexham English Bible does not include the shorter ending of Mark in their translation.  So in order for the English text to match up with the Greek text, I provided my own fairly literal translation (and a translator's note) in the style of the LEB.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>All the program data is stored in an <a href="https://sqlite.org">SQLite</a> database.
