<p spacebelow=10>The Greek Study Project was inspired by the outstanding <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/greekkit/id919649936">GreekKit</a> app by Casey Perkins.  It is by far (IMHO) the best app for reading the New Testament in Greek.  Unfortunately it is only available on iOS.  The Greek Study Project began as a poor attempt to replicate in Android what I considered to be GreekKit's most outstanding features of reading and searching the Greek New Testament.</p>

<p spacebelow=10>And as so often happens in programming projects, feature creep began to set in.  Since I wrote this in LiveCode, which can cross-compile, I decided to (eventually) make desktop versions and an iOS version.  And then I decided to include things that I wish that I'd had when I was first studying Greek.  So now there is reference section of Greek grammatical forms as well as a Vocabulary tutor.  This Vocabulary tutor is based on the <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> flashcard app.  The vocabulary tutor in this app is very simple in comparison to Anki's capabilities, so check out Anki if you need a powerful flashcard program.  There is also a wealth of vocabulary lists for Greek (and everything else imaginable) available for download and use with Anki at its website <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">ankiweb.net</a>.</p>

<p spacebelow=10>The Greek text of the New Testament used in this app is the <a href="https://www.sblgnt.com/">SBL Greek New Testament</a> produced by the <a href="https://www.sbl-site.org/">Society of Biblical Literature</a> and <a href="https://www.logos.com/">Logos Bible Software</a>.  The entire New Testament academic community is deeply in their debt both for the work that it took to produce this edition as well as their decision to make it freely available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons License</a>.  I obtained the text from their <a href="https://github.com/LogosBible/SBLGNT">GitHub site</a>.</p>

<p spacebelow=10>The dictionary definitions used in this app come primarily from John Jeffrey Dodson's lexicon which he prepared as part of his book <i>The Greek New Testament for Beginning Readers : The Byzantine Greek Text</i> and then placed in the public domain.  The copyright notice for his lexicon reads as follows:</p>

<p spacebelow=10>I obtained Dr. Dodson's lexicon through this <a href="https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/Dodson-Greek-Lexicon/">GitHub project</a> which has taken his PDF file and made it machine-readable.</p>

<p spacebelow=10>In places where Dodson's lexicon did not include adequate definitions for words found in the SBLGNT, glosses were obtained from the Perseus' Project Digital Library of Tufts University.  They offer <a href="https://github.com/PerseusDL">GitHub repositories</a> of all their materials under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons License</a>.</p>

<p spacebelow=5>The morphological parsing of the SBLGNT comes from <a href="https://github.com/morphgnt/sblgnt">MorphGNT: SBLGNT Edition</a>, made available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons License</a>.</p>

<p spacebelow=10>John 7:52-8:11, however, is not in the SBLGNT published text, and so there is no morphological data for those verses in MorphGNT.  While I agree that this pericope is not originally part of John's Gospel, it is still included in all modern English translations.  Fortunately the text and morphological data are available from the syntax trees at the <a href="https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/greek-new-testament">Biblical Humanities Greek New Testament</a> for the SBLGNT. So in the interest of having a complete Greek text that a student could follow while reading a modern ENglish translation, I extracted the text and morphological data from the syntax trees at the <a href="https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/greek-new-testament/tree/70adc52dc58cf349835112eb1c8e1cb8cc83745c/syntax-trees/sblgnt">GitHub site</a> and included them in this program.  The syntax trees are made available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons License</a>.</p>

<p spacebelow=10>The grammatical forms in the Study section come mostly from the <a href="https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Ancient_Greek_grammar_tables">Wikionary Ancient Greek grammar tables</a> which are made available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons License</a> and from the online Greek textbook <a href="https://www.publiconsulting.com/wordpress/ancientgreek/">Ancient Greek for Everyone: Essential Morphology and Syntax for Beginning Greek</a> by Wilfred E. Major and Michael Laughy.  Their work is generously made available also under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons License</a>.</p>
