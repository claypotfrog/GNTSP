<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the Vocabulary Icon brings up the Vocabulary Tutor which includes a number of lists of vocabulary words which you can review.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocabscreen.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>At present there are lists of words by frequency and lists of words from first-year Greek textbooks.  But you can create new lists yourself or import lists that others have created and shared with you.</p>
<h3>Reviewing Vocabulary Words</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>First click on the Vocabulary List you wish to study.  This takes you to the Vocabulary Groups screen for that list.  Here you choose which subsets of vocabulary words you wish to study from the entire list.  In the image below, we clicked on the first Vocabulary List, "All Words by Frequency".  You can see the Vocabulary List name at the top of this screen.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-enter.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>By default, none of the vocabulary groups are enabled for review.  So they all say "Not Studying" and the switch button is not lit.  Clicking on the switch button (or the "Not Studying" text) will toggle whether you wish to include that group when you review this vocabulary list.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the following image, the groups "Words appearing 400 or more times" and "Words appearing 200 to 399 times" are both enabled.  So their switch buttons are lit blue and the text (now in a blue bar) says "Studying".  With both these groups enabled, you will be reviewing all words in the Greek text which appear 200 or more times.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocablist.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can enable and disable the groups in order to review the collections of vocabulary words which you are interested in.  Once you have enabled any groups to review, the "Study" button at the top of the screen will become enabled.  Clicking on that button will take you to the Vocabulary Review screen.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocabstudy.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the Vocabulary Review screen, all the words in all the groups which you selected to review are randomized and presented to you one at a time.  At the bottom of the screen, the number of words remaining to review is on the left in red and the number of words which you have seen is in blue on the right.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>After looking at the word and (hopefully) remembering its meaning, click anywhere on the screen to display the gloss and see if you correctly knew the word.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocabstudy-show.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The gloss and the number of occurrences in the Greek text are shown as well as the principle parts (of verbs) and any notes which you have attached to this word.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>At the bottom there will now be four colored buttons from which you need to choose one to tell the app when you wish to next see this word in your studies.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocabbuttons.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you choose the red "Again" button, then the word will be added (randomly) to the end of your review list, and you will see it again during this review session.  If you choose any of the three buttons marked with days, however, then you will not see the word again for that many days.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>So if you choose "1 Day", then you will not see this word again in this session.  But if you review these words again tomorrow, you will again see this word.  Likewise, if you choose the "2 Days" button, then you will not see this word again while reviewing today, nor will you see it if you review these words tomorrow.  But you will see it when you review these words at least two days from now.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>The next time you see this word, your choices for how long to delay before seeing the word again will also change.  You will always have the red "Again" button which shows you the word again that same review session.  But for any other time delay you choose greater than 1 day, the next time you see the word, your previous choice will be in the green button, with half that delay to the left of it in the orange button and twice that delay in the blue button to the right of it.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In addition, the delay that you chose last time will have a black border around it.  So if you previously chose "Again", then when the word comes around again, the "Again" button will be outlined in black.  Likewise, if you choose "1 Day", then the next time you study and see this word, the "1 Day" button will be outlined in black.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Imagine that you choose the "4 Days" button in the above example.  Then the next time that you see the word, you will see the following buttons:</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocabstudy-4.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>"4 Days" is in the green button and is outlined in black (because it was your previous choice), "2 Days" (half of 4) is in the orange button, and "8 Days" (twice 4) is in the blue button.  If you were to choose "4 Days" again, then you will see this same configuration of buttons when next you see this word.  If you were to choose "2 Days", however, then the next time you see the word you will see the same buttons you saw before - "1 Day", "2 Days", and "4 Days", and the "2 Days" button will be outlined in black.  If you were to choose "8 Days", on the other hand, then the next time you see the word, you will see the following buttons:</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocabstudy-8.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The idea is that as you come to know words better and better, you need to review them less frequently.  So you tell the app to delay showing them to you again until further in the future.  Words you are not as familiar with, you can tell the app to show to you repeatedly, day after day, until you feel confident enough to push it out two days, then four days, etc.  Hopefully this maximizes the benefit of your vocabulary study time.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>By default, the vocabulary tutor has a 6 month limit on the maximum amount of much time which can pass until you see a word again.  Once you get to the limit, then both the Green and Blue squares will have that limit in them.  You can change the default from 1 to 12 months by clicking on the blue settings icon in the upper left corner of the main Vocabulary page.  This brings up the Vocabulary settings dialog box.  The bottom item shows you what your maximum study interval is.  In the following image, you can see that it's set to the default of 6 months.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/max-interval-6.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the blue line which says, "6 months" brings up a menu item where you can choose your limit from 1 to 12 months. Here we have chosen "9 months" from the menu.  So the maximum amount of time we can choose until we see a word again is now 9 months.  (<i>In this program, all months are considered 30 days long.  So a 6 month limit is really a 180 day limit.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/max-interval-9.png"></p>
 <p spacebelow=10>There is also an option on this dialog box to enforce this limit on all words you are presently studying.  If you check the box which says "Apply Interval to existing words", then when you click the "Done" button, the program will go through all the words that you are presently studying and change the date you will next see the word to this limit if their date was set to longer than that.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Back on the Vocabulary tutor screen, in the upper left of the screen, is a blue (triangle) Back icon.  Clicking that icon will take you back to the previous word so you can change the delay interval.  Your choice now will overwrite your previous choice.  You can go back as many words as you wish in this session, all the way back to the first word.  But you will need to choose a delay again for each word; there's no way to "jump" back to where you were in the list.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocabstudy-back.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can click away from the vocabulary tutor at any time using the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.  The program will pause your session and remember where you are.  Clicking on the Vocabulary icon later will bring you back to where you left off.  You end a session by clicking on the "Exit" link at the top of the screen which will return you to the screen where you choose which vocabulary groups to review.</p>
