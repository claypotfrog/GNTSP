<p spacebelow=10>By default, the program will follow the settings of your Operating System's preferences for whether it displays in Light or Dark mode.  (<i>Since Windows and Linux do not have a system appearance setting, they always display in Light Mode.</i>)  You can, however, manually tell the program to display always in either Light or Dark mode.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>On the Read screen, click the blue gear icon in the upper right of the Read screen to access the Settings dialog box.  Below the three settings for fonts is a picture icon with the words "Use System Theme" in blue.  This means that the program is following the operating system preferences. </p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/fontsettings.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click on that blue line, and you will see that there are two other options available to you, "Show Light Theme" and "Show Dark Theme".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/theme-settings.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Choosing "Show Light Theme" will ignore the operating system preferences and always display in Light Mode.  Likewise, Choosing "Show Dark Theme" will always display in Dark Mode.  Moreover, whenever you change this option, the changes take place immediately.  You do not need to click "Done" for the program to apply your choices as you do for all the other options in the Setting dialog.  Choosing "Cancel" after changing the Theme, therefore, has no effect.  If you change this setting and then want to discard your changes, you must manually change it back.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below, we have selected "Show Dark Theme" so all screens in the program will now display in dark mode.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/theme-dark.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The program remembers your choice and will apply it every time it opens.  If you wish to change to a different theme (or back to following the operating system preferences), you must manually make that choice in the Settings dialog.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>Please note that except for this page, all the images in the About pages are taken in Light mode.  So they will appear in different colors than you will see them when viewing in Dark Mode.  But aside from the colors, everything is exactly the same.</i></p>
