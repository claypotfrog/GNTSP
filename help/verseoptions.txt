<p spacebelow=10>On both the Greek and English pages, you can bookmark, highlight, copy, save, and share verses.  You access these actions by clicking on a verse number itself in either the Greek or English text.  In the image below, we have clicked on the "6" at the beginning of John 1:6 in the Greek text.  (<i>You can see which verse(s) you have selected at the top of the Verse Actions dialog box.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The Verse Actions dialog box shows you the verses as a range.  When you first bring the dialog box up, the range is only a single verse, in this case John 1:6 - 1:6".  But you can click on the chapter and verse numbers on the right side (which are in blue) to select any verse further along in the book and extend the range to that verse.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the following image, we have clicked on the verse number on the right side, the blue "6", and we now have a drop-menu from which we can choose a new verse in chapter 1.  Since the range starts at verse 6, we cannot select a verse earlier than that.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_setrange_verse.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Remember that you cannot select a verse behind where you have started, so if you wish to Highlight or Copy a range of verses, make sure you select the earlier verse first and then extend the range forward.  In the image below, we have selected verse 21:1 of John.  Since 21 is the last in John, if we click the blue "21" on the right hand side to extend the range to a new chapter, there is no other chapter we can select.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/range_max_chapter.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>For this example, let's select the entire paragraph in the Greek Text of John 1:6-9. So we leave the chapter set to "1" on the right side of the range and we click on the blue "6" to bring up the verse menu.  We select verse 9 as the end of our range.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now you can see that the title of the Verse Actions dialog box  shows the range at the top, "John 1:6-1:9".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_rangeselected.png"></p>
<h3>Bookmarking Verses</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Click on the "Bookmark" button to add this verse to your bookmarks list.  If you have selected a range of verses, then the first verse in the range will be selected.  (<i>If you wish to bookmark multiple verses within a range, you must select and bookmark them individually.  You cannot bookmark every verse in a range, only the first one.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>The button will turn blue to indicate that you have bookmarked it.  Any time you click on this verse, the "Bookmark" button will be highlighted in blue to show you that the verse has been bookmarked.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_bookmark.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you wish to remove the bookmark, simply click the "Bookmark" button again.  The button will change back to normal, and the verse will no longer be included in your list of bookmarks. (<i>You can also delete bookmarks in the bookmark window. See below.</i>)</p>
<h3>Highlighting Verses</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Also in the Verse Actions dialog box, you can highlight verses.  Click on the "Highlight" button to highlight the verse (or verse range) in the color shown to the right of the button.  (In this example we'll use yellow.)  The "Highlight" button will turn blue to indicate that this verse (or range of verses) is highlighted.  Any time you click on this verse or select this verse range, this button will be highlighted in blue to show you that the verse has been highlighted.  In addition, the color square to the right of the "Highlight" button will show you the color that this verse (or range of verses) is highlighted.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below we have highlighted the the range of verse John 1:6-9.  You can see some of the yellow highlighted verses behind the Verse Actions dialog box.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_hilite.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Like the Bookmark button, you can remove a highlight by clicking again on the blue "Highlight" button. The button will return to normal and the highlight will no longer be included in your list of highlighted verses. (<i>You can also delete highlights in the highlight window. See below.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Please note that when you select a range of verses, the "Highlight" button will be blue only if <i>every</i> verse in that range is highlighted.  Moreover, the color of the color square next to the "Highlight" button will be the color of the majority of the verses if they are highlighted different colors.  So if your range has three verses highlighted green and two verses highlighted blue, then the color square will be green.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>If any of the verses in the range are not highlighted, however, then the "Highlight" button will not be blue and so clicking it again will not remove the highlighting from any verse in the range which are highlighted.  (But you could click the "Highlight" button to first highlight all the verses, then immediately click it again to remove the highlighting from all the verses in that range.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Close the Verse Actions dialog box by clicking the "Done" button, and we can see that the range of verses we selected has been highlighted in yellow.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/text_hilited_yellow.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Please also note that whether you highlight and bookmark verses in either the Greek or the English text, both are affected.  So in the image below, you can see that John 1:6-9 is also highlighted in yellow in the English text since highlighting either the Greek or English text always highlights those same verses in the other text as well.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/englishtext_hilited_yellow.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can change the color used for the next highlighting by clicking on the color square to the right of the "Highlight" button.  This will bring up the color palate where you can choose your highlight color. (<i>Changing the color does not change the color of any existing highlights.  This only sets the color for the next time you highlight verses.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_colors.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you change colors, the "Highlight" button will no longer be highlighted in blue, so you can click it again and highlight this verse (or verse range) in the new color regardless of what color it is presently highlighted in.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below, you can see that even though the text is highlighted in yellow (you can see it behind the Verse Action window), the "Highlight" button is not blue because we have chosen a new highlight color.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_blue_hilite.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click the "Highlight" button again, and you can see that verse range (behind the dialog box) is now highlighted in the new color we choose from the color palate.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/text_hilited_blue.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can see all the verses which you have bookmarked and/or highlighted by clicking on the blue Bookmark (ribbon) icon just to the left of the name of the Book you are reading.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/bookmark_icon.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>On the Bookmarks/Highlights page, the selection chooser at the top tells you whether you are looking at Bookmarks or Highlights.  Here on the Bookmarks screen, you see John 1:6, the verse which we have just bookmarked, as well as other verses which we have previously bookmarked.  You can have as many bookmarked verses as you wish.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/bookmark_items.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>In order to see what verses you have highlighted, click on the word "Highlights" in the selection chooser at the top.  Now the window shows all the verses in the program which we have highlighted.  Since we highlighted the range of verses from John 1:6 to 9, each of these verses is listed.  Notice that the verse reference is highlighted in the same color as the verse itself is highlighted.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/bookmark_hilites.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on any of these lines in either the Bookmarks or the Highlights window will take you to that verse in the Read page. (<i>In that sense, bookmarks and highlights work identically.<i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can delete bookmarks and highlights by clicking on the blue "Edit" link in the upper right of the window to put the list into EDIT mode.  Then click the red half-circle next to the bookmark or highlight that you wish to delete, and finally click the "Delete" button to remove that bookmark or highlight.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/bookmark_delete.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once we remove a highlight from the list, that verse is no longer highlighted in the text.  Since we removed the highlight from verse 9 of John 1, you can see now that John 1:6-8 are still highlighted, but verse 9 no longer is.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/text_no_hilite.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>By default, bookmarks appear on the list in the order in which you created them with the newest bookmark always appearing first.  But you can rearrange the order of the bookmarks in the list.  (<i>You cannot reorder highlights; they always appear in the same order the verses appear in the Biblical text.</i>)  When you click the "Edit" link in the upper right while viewing Bookmarks, you will not only see the red half-circle icon on the left side of each verse, but the Reorder icon (three horizontal gray bars) on the right side.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/bookmark_reorder.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click and hold the Reorder icon on any line and you can drag that bookmark anywhere you desire on the list.  In the image below, we have dragged the first bookmark, John 1:6, to the bottom of the list so now it is the last bookmark.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/bookmark_reordered.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click the blue "Done" in the upper right to exit EDIT mode.  Use the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen to return to the Read page.  (<i>You do not have the click the "Done" button before you leave this page.  The bookmarks and highlights list will automatically exit EDIT mode when you leave this page.  You only need to click "Done" if you then want to click on a bookmark or highlight and go to that verse in on the Read page.</i>)</p>
<h3>Copying, Saving, and Sharing Verses</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Back in the Verse Actions dialog box, you can copy a verse (or range of verses) to the clipboard or save them to a file.  In addition, if you are on a Mobile device, you can "share" the text using the Mobile device's Sharing menu.  (<i>Please note that if you are reading the Greek text when you open the Verse Actions dialog box, then you will copy the Greek text.  If you are on the English page, then you will copy the English text.  It is not possible to copy both Greek and English in the same time.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Which options you see depends on which operating system you are using.  If you are using the program on a desktop, then you will see two buttons, "Copy" and "Save", are active, but the "Share" button is disabled.  Desktop Operating Systems do not have Sharing menus like Mobile devices do, but they can copy and save text.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click the "Copy" button to put the text on the clipboard so you can paste it into another program.  Likewise, click the "Save" button to save the text as a file on your hard drive.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_rangeselected.png"></p>

<p spacebelow=10>On Android devices, all three buttons will (probably) be active. The "Copy" button will place the text on your device's clipboard.  The "Save" button will save the text of the verses as a file to your device's public "Download" folder.  (<i>If the program cannot find your public "Download" folder, then this button will be disabled.</i>)  So you cannot choose where you save the file, only the title you give it.  Use the Android "Files" program to access the file that you have saved.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_android.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The "Share" button will open up your Android device's Sharing.  (<i>If your device is not set up for sharing, then this button will be disabled.</i>)  The Sharing menu allows you to save the text as a file to Google Drive, as an attachment on an email, etc. (Your exact options will depend on how your device is configured.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Be aware that the Sharing menu works with a <i>file</i> that contains the verse text, not the text itself.  If you use the Sharing menu to share the text in an email, then the text will be attached as a file to the email.  If you wish to have the text itself in the body of an email, then use the "Copy" button to put the text on the clipboard, then create an email, and finally paste the text into the body.
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/android_sharing.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>On iOS devices, the "Copy" and "Share" buttons will be active while the "Save" button will be disabled.  iOS devices always use the Share menu regardless of which button you press.  The buttons, however, control whether the Share menu is using the text itself, or a file containing the text.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_ios.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>From this menu you can copy the text to the clipboard, save the text to a file, paste the text into a message or a reminder, etc.  (Your exact options will depend on your device and how it is configured.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/ios_sharing.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Whichever button you press, you will see the same Sharing menu.  The difference is what is being "shared".  If you press the "Copy" button, then the text itself is being shared.  So if you use the Sharing menu to create a text menu, the text of the verses will be pasted into the text message.  Below is an image of using the "Copy" button to share a verse as a text message.  As you can see, the actual text of the verse is copied into the text message.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_ios_copy.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>But in the following image below, we have clicked the "Share" button and then choose to share the verse as a text message.  You can see that the text of the verse itself is not put into the text message but rather a file which contains the text of the verse.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_ios_share.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>So which button you use depends on how you wish to use the text.  If you want to copy it to your clipboard, then choose "Copy" and then press the "Copy" button in the Share menu.  (If you choose "Share" then you will put a file on your clipboard, not the text.)  Likewise if you wish to attach a file to an email or save a file to a drive, then choose "Share" so that you are working with a file of the text, not the text itself.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Before you copy or share the verse(s), moreover, you can use the "Include Verse Numbers" and "Include Verse Reference" toggle switches to control whether the text you copy includes these items.  If you enable the "Include Verse Numbers" toggle switch, then the verse numbers will be included in the text you copy.  Likewise if you enable the "Include Reference" toggle switch, the verse reference will be included at the top of the copied text as well.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have set the switches to include (or not) the verse numbers and the reference, click the "Copy" button to copy this verse to the clipboard.  When you copy the English text, please be aware that the <u>underlining</u>, <i>italics</i>, and blue ampersands (<font color="blue">@</font>) - indicating a translators' note) are all removed.</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Here is what will be copied from our verse range of John 1:6-9 if we include both verse numbers and the reference.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/copied_verse_ref_num.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Here is the same range showing verse numbers but not the reference.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/copied_verse_num.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Here is the same range showing the reference but not the verse numbers.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/copied_verse_ref.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>And finally here is the same range showing neither the reference nor the verse numbers.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/copied_verse.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>(<i>At the moment, paragraph markers are not included in the copied text.  So if you copy a range of verses which includes a new paragraph in either the Greek or English text, the copied text will all be one paragraph.</i>)
<p spacebelow=10>Remember that once you have completed everything you wish to do with this verse or range of verses, you must click the "Done" button to return to the Read screen.</p>
<h3>File Names</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>While Linux and Android allow the colon (":") in filenames, Windows, MacOS, and iOS do not.  When saving the name of a range as a filename on Windows, MacOS, or iOS, therefore, the program will change all colons to commas.  So the program will not create a file called "John 3:16" but rather "John 3,16".  Of course, if know that you will be uploading the file to a drive which allows colons in filenames (like Google Drive),  you can change the commas back to colons.  But commas are <i>always</i> safe in file names while colons not.</p>
