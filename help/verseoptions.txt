<p spacebelow=10>On both the Greek and English pages, you can bookmark, highlight, and copy verses.  You can access these actions by clicking on a verse number itself in either the Greek or English text.  In the image below, we have clicked on the "6" at the  beginning of John 1:6.  (You can see which verse you have selected at the top of the Verse Actions window.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click on the "Bookmark Verse" button to add this verse to your bookmark list.  The button will turn blue to indicate that you have bookmarked it.  Any time you click on this verse, the button will remain highlighted in blue to show you that the verse has been bookmarked.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you wish to remove the highlight, simply click the "Bookmark Verse" button again.  The button will change back to normal and the verse will no longer be included in your list of bookmarks. You can also delete bookmarks in the bookmark window. <i>(See below.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_bookmark.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Also in the Verse Actions menu, you can highlight verses.  Click on the "Highlight Verse" button to highlight the verse in the color shown to the right of the button.  (By default this is yellow.)  The "Highlight Verse" button will turn blue to indicate that this verse is highlighted.  Any time you click on this verse, this button will remain highlighted in blue to show you that the verse has been highlighted.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_hilite.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Like the Bookmark button, you can remove a highlight by clicking on the blue Highlight Verse button. The button will return to normal and the highlight will no longer be included in your list of highlighted verses. You can also delete highlights in the highlight window. <i>(See below.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Close the Verse Actions window by clicking the "Done" button, and you will see that the verse has been highlighted in that color.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/text_hilited_yellow.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can change the color of the highlight for this verse by clicking on the color square to the right of the "Highlight Verse" button.  This will bring up the color palate where you can choose your highlight color.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_colors.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you change colors, the "Highlight Verse" button will no longer be highlighted in blue indicating that you can click on it again to highlight this verse in the new color.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_blue_hilite.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click the "Highlight Verse" button again and now the verse is highlighted in the new color.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/text_hilited_blue.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>(If you highlighted a verse in previous version of the program, and the highlight color now appears different, it probably is.  Some of the highlight colors were changed when dark mode was added so that they work in both light and dark mode.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can see all your bookmarks and all your highlights by clicking on the blue Bookmark icon in the upper left of the Read screen.  The title tells you whether you are looking at Bookmarks or Highlights.  Here on the Bookmarks screen, you see John 1:6, the verse which we have just bookmarked, as well as other verses which we have previously bookmarked.  You can have as many bookmarked verses as you wish.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/bookmark_items.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>In order to see what verses you have highlighted, click on the Exchange arrows in the upper left of the window.  Now the window shows our highlighted verses.  Notice that you see the verse reference highlighted in the same color as the verse itself is highlighted.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/bookmark_hilites.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on any of these lines in either the Bookmarks or the Highlights window will take you to that verse in the Read page. <i>(In that sense, bookmarks and highlights work identically.)<i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can delete bookmarks and highlights by clicking on the blue "Edit" link in the upper right of the window to put the list into EDIT mode.  Then click the red minus sign next to the bookmark or highlight that you wish to delete, and finally click the "Delete" button to remove that bookmark or highlight.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/bookmark_delete.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once we remove a highlight from the list, that verse is no longer highlighted in the text.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/text_no_hilite.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>By default, bookmarks appear on the list in the order in which you created them with the newest bookmark always appearing first.  But you can rearrange the order of the bookmarks in the list.  <i>(You cannot reorder highlights; they always appear in the same order the verses appear in the Biblical text.)</i>  When you click the "Edit" link in the upper right while viewing Bookmarks, you will not only see the red half-circle icon on the left side of each verse, but the Reorder icon (three horizontal gray bars) on the right side.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/bookmark_reorder.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click and drag the Reorder icon, and you can drag that bookmark anywhere you desire on the list.  In the image below, we have dragged the first bookmark, John 1:6, to the bottom of the list so now it is the last bookmark.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/bookmark_reordered.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click the blue "Done" in the upper right to exit EDIT mode.  Use the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen to return to the Read page.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Finally, back in the Verse Actions menu, you can copy a verse to the clipboard so you can paste it elsewhere.  Click on the "Include Reference" toggle switch (or the "Include Reference" label itself) to indicate if you want the reference copied as well.  If the "Include Reference" toggle switch is active then the verse reference (in this case John "1:6") will be copied as well as the text of the verse.  If the toggle switch is not active, then only the text of the verse will be copied.  (In the image below, the toggle switch is active.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseoptions_blue_hilite.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have set the switch to include (or not) the reference, click the "Copy Verse" button to copy this verse to the clipboard.  When you copy the English text, moreover, the <u>underlining</u>, <i>italics</i>, and blue ampersands (<font color="blue">@</font>) - indicating a translators' note) are all automatically removed.</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you are using this program on a desktop computer, that's all you need to do.  You can paste the text of the verse directly into any other application.  Because Mobile devices implement their clipboards differently, however, if you are on a mobile device, there is one additional step you must take.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>On mobile, rather than being placed on the clipboard, the verse (and reference if you choose to include it) are placed in a mobile field specific to your mobile device.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/mobile_manual_copy.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You must manually highlight the text and then click on "Copy" in the mobile menu which appears.  Now the text has been placed on your mobile clipboard and you can paste it into other applications.  Click the blue "Done" at the bottom of the window to return to the Verse Actions window.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/mobile_manual_hilite.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>(Please note that this mobile field can be edited and your mobile keyboard will be enabled.  Nothing you change here will affect the Greek or English text in the program, however.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have completed everything you wish to do with this verse, click the "Done" button to return to the Read screen.</p>
