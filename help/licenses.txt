The license  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the      FreeType code. (`credits')  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus  encourage you to use the following text:   """    Portions of this software are copyright ï¿½ <year> The FreeType    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.   """  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you  actually use.Legal Terms===========0. Definitions--------------  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,  beta or final release.  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType  engine'.  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by  this license, you must contact us to verify this.  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as  specified below.1.

IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.2. Redistribution-----------------  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted  herein, subject to the following conditions:    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source      files.    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid  to us.3. Advertising--------------  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional  purposes without specific prior written permission.  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms  of this license.4.

The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself.The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Alsoincluded in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and ajust-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. Theseare both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.THE BASIC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS---------------------------Written by:       Philip HazelEmail local part: ph10Email domain:     cam.ac.ukUniversity of Cambridge Computing Service,Cambridge, England.Copyright (c) 1997-2012 University of CambridgeAll rights reserved.PCRE JUST-IN-TIME COMPILATION SUPPORT-------------------------------------Written by:       Zoltan HerczegEmail local part: hzmesterEmain domain:     freemail.huCopyright(c) 2010-2012 Zoltan HerczegAll rights reserved.STACK-LESS JUST-IN-TIME COMPILER--------------------------------Written by:       Zoltan HerczegEmail local part: hzmesterEmain domain:     freemail.huCopyright(c) 2009-2012 Zoltan HerczegAll rights reserved.THE C++ WRAPPER FUNCTIONS-------------------------Contributed by:   Google Inc.Copyright (c) 2007-2012, Google Inc.All rights reserved.THE "BSD" LICENCE-----------------Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or withoutmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,      this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the      documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.    * Neither the name of the University of Cambridge nor the name of Google      Inc. nor the names of their contributors may be used to endorse or      promote products derived from this software without specific prior      written permission.THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS"AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSEARE DISCLAIMED.
