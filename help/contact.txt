<p spacebelow=10>My name is Jeff Jansen.  I spent twenty years in IT as a missionary with Wycliffe Bible Translators, and am now a pastor living in Atlanta, GA.  I have a degree (from many years ago) in Classical Greek, so I have always had a love of the Ancient Greek language and history.</p>

If you can code in LiveCode or write SQL, so much the better.  Feel free to clone <a href="https://github.com/claypotfrog/GNTSP">the project at GitHub</a> and send me a pull request.  Unfortunately, LiveCode stacks do not diff and are stored by git as binary blobs.  Or you can simply send me the script page(s) containing your changes.</p>
