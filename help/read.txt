<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the Read icon brings up the text of the Society of Biblical Literature Greek New Testament (SBLGNT) and the Lexham English Bible (LEB). (<i>See the Credits for more information on these two texts.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>At the top of the screen are drop-down menus for selecting the book and chapter you wish to read.  Click on the book name to bring up the book drop-down menu, and click on the chapter number to bring up the chapter drop-down menu.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Here we have clicked on the book name "John" to bring up the list of books.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/bookselect.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Here we have clicked on the chapter number "1" to bring up the list of chapters.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/chapterselect.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on a chapter number brings up a list of verses in this chapter.  Here we have clicked on the "2" (i.e chapter 2),and now we see a list of all the verses in chapter 2 of John.</p> 
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseselect.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below we have clicked on the "6", and so the program has put verse 6 of chapter 2 at the top of the display.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verseselected.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Aside from using the chapter drop-down, you can move through a book by scrolling up and down.  As you scroll, the Chapter number will update to show you which chapter you are reading in.  You cannot, however, scroll to the next or previous book.  You must change books by selecting them in the Book drop-down.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Immediately below the Book and Chapter menus is where you choose whether you wish to see the text of the Greek New Testament or the Lexham English Bible.  Clicking on the item to the left labeled "Greek" will bring up the text of the Greek New Testament.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/langchooser-greek.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>And clicking on the item to the right labeled "English" will bring up the text of the Lexham English Bible.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/langchooser-english.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you are on a mobile device, you can also swipe right and left to switch between the Greek and English texts.  But default the option to swipe to change languages is enabled.  But you can enable and disable swiping in the Settings dialog box (see next paragraph).</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the blue gear icon in the upper right corner brings up the "Settings" dialog for that language.  Here you can change the font as well as adjust the font size and line spacing for the Greek and English text.  When you first run the program, it will display all the text in both Greek and English in the "Gentium Plus" font.  But you can switch to any font that is available on your device.  In addition, the program itself includes the "Gentium Plus" font as well as "Galatia SIL", "SBL Greek", "Literata", and "Montserrat" fonts.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/fontsettings.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>(<i>Please note that the font settings for each language are independent of each other.  You can set either text to any available font.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>As you are reading the Greek text, clicking on any word will highlight that word and bring up a box with the word's dictionary entry and gloss.  Below the gloss is the grammatical parsing for this word in this occurrence.  You can also see the total number of times this word appears (in any form) in the Greek text in the upper right-hand corner.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/wordclick.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking anywhere on the blue dialog box will bring up the Details screen for this particular (dictionary) word.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/details-logos.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Here you will see the word's dictionary entry at the top as well as its part-of-speech, its gloss, the number of times it occurs (in any form) in the Greek text, and the number of different forms in which it appears in the text.  If you have added any notes to this word, they will appear here.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In addition, if the word is a verb, then its principal parts (if they have been entered in the database) will be displayed here as well.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/lego.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>All of these lines can be clicked on to bring up more information or to allow editing.  <i>See the <b>Details</b> section on the "Help" page for more information about the functions of this screen.</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/details-logos-noplay.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click the back arrow in the upper left corner or the "Read" icon at the bottom of the screen to return to the Read screen from this Details screen.  This word (in all forms) will be highlighted in the book where you are reading.  You can remove the highlighting by pressing and holding anywhere on the text screen until the highlights disappear.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/hilited.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Hopefully with all this information, you will be able to read the Greek text.  But if you find yourself unable to understand the Greek, click on the English tab at the top of the text, and you can see how the Lexham English Bible (LEB) translated that passage.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Moreover, the LEB includes visual clues which will help you understand how the LEB translators translated the Greek text in English.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>For example, any word or words which you see in brackets and italicized <i>[like this]</i> are words which do not appear in the Greek text but which are implied or are necessary to supply in English for the translation to make sense.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/englishtext-italics.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>In addition, words and phrases which are underlined <u>like this</u> are places where the Greek text uses an idiom.  There is always a translation note attached to these which you can read to see the original Greek idiom.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Translation notes are indicated by superscripted blue ampersands (<font color="blue"><sup shift="-4">@</sup></font>).  Click on these to access the LEB translation notes for the previous word or words.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/englishclick.png"></p>
<h3>Progress Tracking</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>You can also (manually) track your progress in reading through the Greek text if you so desire.  Click on the blue ribbon icon at the top of the screen to the left of the name of the book you are reading.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/bookmark_icon.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>This brings up a page that shows you which verses (if any) you have bookmarked or highlighted, as well as your reading progress.  The selection chooser at the top shows you which you are viewing.  We are interested in tracking our progress, so click the word "Progress" in the selection chooser.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/progress_screen.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>This brings up a listing of all the books in the Greek New Testament.  The top line shows you how many chapters out of the entire Greek New Testment (which contains 260 chapters in total) you have marked as read.  After that, each line shows you a book and how many chapters in that book you have marked as read out of the total number of chapters in that book.  Since we are just starting out, nothing is marked, so all the books say "0/X". (<i>If you have marked any chapters as read, then the total will be in bold.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>At first, all the books are collapsed, so you cannot see any of the chapters to mark them as read.  To open a book, click on the book name or the blue caret on the left side of the line.  This will expand the entry so you can see (and mark) chapters.  Let's assume that we are reading the gospel of John, so we'll click on the line for "John".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/john_expanded.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now the blue caret on the left points down (indicating that the book is expanded) and we see a line for every chapter in John.  Click on the text "chapter X" or the switch on the right side of the line to "flip" the switch and indicate that we have read this book.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/john_expanded_marked.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Here we have clicked on chapters 1 through 3 to show that we have read those three chapters in the Greek.  The switch on each line is now highlighted in blue and on the "John" line, it now shows "3/21" which means we have read three of the twenty-one chapters in the gospel of John.  In addition, the top line also shows that we have read three of the 260 chapters in the entire New Testament.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can click on the book name or the blue caret to collapse any line that expanded.  In the image below, we have clicked on the "John" line again to collapse it.  We cannot see the individual chapters, but we still see that we have marked three of them as read.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/john_collapsed.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>This feature is entirely manual.  The program has no way of knowing what you actually read, so you must flip these switches yourself for each chapter after you have read it.  But hopefully having an easy way to track your reading progress will encourage you as you read through the Greek New Testament.</p>
