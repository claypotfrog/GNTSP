<p spacebelow=10>If you do a lot of work creating and/or deleting vocabulary lists and groups, then you are going to see a lot of warnings.  Every time you delete anything, the program will ask you for confirmation because deletions are permanent.  But if you are deleting a lot, this can get tiresome.  So you can turn the delete warnings off.  On the main "Read" page, click the blue gear icon in the upper-right to open up the "Settings" dialogue.  Near the bottom of the window, you'll see a checkbox labeled "Show Vocabulary Delete Warnings".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/fontsettings.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Un-check that checkbox, and now the program will never ask for confirmation for a vocabulary deletion.  Press "Delete", and it's gone.  This change remains the default every time you run the program.  If you want to turn the warnings back on, you must do so by re-checking the checkbox in the "Settings" dialogue.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In addition, if you create a number of vocabulary groups by typing or pasting words in directly, every time you click the "Add Words" link, if there are any words in the import field which the app cannot identify, then you will receive a warning and those words will remain in the import field.  You can also turn this warning off in the same main "Settings" dialogue.  There is a checkbox at the bottom of the window labeled "Show Vocabulary Import Warnings".</p>

<p spacebelow=10>As with turning off the delete warnings, this change remains the default every time you run the program.  If you want to turn the warnings back on, you must do so manually by re-checking this checkbox in the "Settings" dialogue.</p>
