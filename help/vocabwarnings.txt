<p spacebelow=10>If you do a lot of work creating and/or deleting vocabulary lists and groups, then you are going to see a lot of warnings.  Every time you delete anything, the program will ask you for confirmation because deletions are permanent.  But if you are deleting a lot, this can get tiresome.  So you can turn the delete warnings off.  On the main "Vocabulary" page click the blue gear icon in the upper left to open up the "Settings" dialogue.  The top checkbox is labeled "Show Vocabulary Delete Warnings".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/show-vocab-del-warning.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Uncheck that checkbox, and now the program will never ask for confirmation for a vocabulary deletion.  Press "Delete", and it's gone.  This change remains the default every time you run the program.  If you want to turn the warnings back on, you must do so by re-checking the checkbox in the "Settings" dialogue.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In addition, if you create a number of vocabulary groups by typing or pasting words in directly, every time you click the "Add Words" link, if there are any words in the import field which the app cannot identify, then you will receive a warning and those words will remain in the import field.  You can also turn this warning off.  On the "Vocabulary Creation" page, click on the blue gear icon in the middle-right of the screen.  The second checkbox is labeled "Show Vocabulary Import Warnings".  Uncheck this box to turn off the error messages when a word cannot be identified.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/show-vocab-error-warning.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now words that cannot be identified will simply be left in the field. As with turning off the delete warnings, this change remains the default every time you run the program.  If you want to turn the warnings back on, you must do so manually by re-checking this checkbox in the "Settings" dialogue.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>(As you probably noticed, both these settings are found in both Vocabulary Setting dialog boxes, the one accessed from the "Vocabulary" page and the one accessed from the "Vocabulary Creator" page.  Both dialog boxes do exactly the same thing.)</i></p>
