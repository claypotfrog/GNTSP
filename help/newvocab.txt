<h3>Creating and Editing Vocabulary Lists</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>On the main Vocabulary List screen, click on "Edit" in the upper right corner to put the lists into EDIT mode.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-edit.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>While in EDIT mode, click on any list title to rename it.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-rename.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can click and drag any line's reorder bars (the three gray horizontal lines on the right side) to reorder the list.  In the image below, we have dragged the first line of the list, "All Words by Frequency", to make it the second line of the list.  <i>(On Android you cannot click and drag the reorder bars directly.  First click on the bars of the row you wish to reorder.  This will put that row into "reorder" mode.  Then you can click anywhere on that row and drag it to a new position.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-reorder.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the adjust button (the red half circle on the left side) will bring up more options for that list.  In the image below we have clicked on the adjust button of the second line "All Verbs by Frequency" which brings up the "Export, "Reset", and "Delete" buttons for that list.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-showoptions.png"></p>
<h3>Export a List</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking the green "Export" button will export this vocabulary list to a file so that you can share the list and import it into the app on another machine.  If you are on a desktop then you'll be prompted to save the vocabulary list just like any other file.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you are on a mobile platform, then you will be prompted to transfer the file.  Which methods are available for transferring the file will depend on how your mobile device is set up.  If you have email on your device, then you can transfer the file as an email message.  A new email will be created with the vocabulary list as the text of the message as well as attached as a ".txt" file.</p>
<h3>Reset a List</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the blue "Reset" button will reset all the words in that vocabulary list so that you will review them again immediately the next time you review any words from this list.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-reset.png"></p>
<h3>Delete a List</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the red "Delete" button will delete this entire vocabulary list.  Once deleted, a list cannot be recovered.  <i>(You can, however, export a list, then restore it by importing it again from the exported file.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click anywhere else in order to return to the normal EDIT mode screen.</p>
<h3>Creating New Vocabulary Lists</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Click on the blue plus sign ("+") in the upper left to create a new list.  There are two ways to create a new list: create the list by hand or import the list using the exported vocabulary list file creating using the "Export" button above.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-create.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you choose "Create New List", then enter a name for the new list in the dialog box which appears.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-new.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The new list will be added to bottom of the vocabulary lists, but you can reorder it at any time by dragging its reorder bars into a new position.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>A new vocabulary list is empty by default.  You must add manually Groups of words you wish to review. <i>(See below.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you choose "Import List", then you must paste the text of the exported vocabulary list file you created using the "Export" button into the dialog box that appears.  Be sure that you only paste in the text from the export file.  <i>(If you are on a desktop, you can right-click the field to bring up an "Open File" dialog where you can select an exported vocabulary file.  The text of the file will be placed in the import field.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-import.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>Please note that the import field can be edited, so you can change any of the lines to change the name of the list, the name of the groups, etc.  But if you alter the format of the lines, the list will not import correctly.</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click the "Import" button and the exported list will be imported into your database.  The imported list will be added to bottom of the vocabulary lists, but you can reorder it at any time by dragging its reorder bars into a new position.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-import-done.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have finished editing, click the "Done" button in the upper right to go back to the main Vocabulary Lists screen.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocabscreen.png"></p>
<h3>Working with Vocabulary Groups in a List</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking any line in the Vocabulary Lists screen will bring up the Vocabulary Groups of words for this Vocabulary list.  Here is where you can create and edit Groups of words, as well as enable different Groups of words to review.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>The name of the main vocabulary list you are viewing will be in the title bar of this screen.  In the image below we have clicked on the "All Words by Frequency" list from the Vocabulary Lists page and gone to the Vocabulary Groups screen.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocablist-nocheck.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on "Edit" in the upper right will put the list into EDIT mode which operates just like it does in the parent Vocabulary Lists screen.  You can click on the Group name to rename it, click and drag the reorder bars to move a Group of words to a new position in the list, and click on the adjust button to Export, Reset, or Delete the Group.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-edit.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The Export, Reset, and Delete button work just like they do for Vocabulary List screen except that operate only on this group.  So if you export a group, then only the words in this group will be exported.</p>
<h3>Creating Vocabulary Groups in a List</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>You create a new Group of words by clicking the blue plus sign ("+") in the upper left.  Here we create new groups by assigning vocabulary words.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below, we are working in the vocabulary list "All Words by Frequency".  <i>(You see the vocabulary list name in the title bar.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-create.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>There are two ways to add vocabulary words to a new vocabulary group.  You can select words en masse by frequency or you can enter individual words.</p>
<h3>Create Group by Frequency</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>To create a new group based on word frequency, select the "Frequency List" button near the top of the screen. <i>(This is the default choice when you create a new list.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Then from the drop-down menu labeled "Select words from:" we choose which books of the Bible we want to select words from.  We can select "All Books", or we can select any individual book from which to select words.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-bookmenu.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you choose a particular book, then you can also choose to select words from the entire book or from only one chapter.  Click on the drop-down menu labeled "Chapter:" and select "All" for the entire book (the default) or choose a particular chapter.</p>
 <p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-chpmenu.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Then from the drop-down menu labeled "Word types:" we choose which types of words we want to select.  We can choose "All Words", or we can limit our selection to only verbs, only nouns, only adjectives, or only "miscellaneous" (which is everything other than verbs, nouns, and adjectives).</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-typemenu.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Next we choose the frequency of words which we want to select.  We can set a minimum frequency and a maximum frequency.  These are the frequencies of words in our selection.  If we choose "All Books" then this is the frequency of words in the whole New Testament.  If we choose the book of "Luke" then this will be the frequency of words found in the entire book of "Luke" (if we chose "All" chapters) or for the chapter we specified.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In this case we want words which appear exactly nine times, so we set the minimum and maximum both to 9.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-frequency.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>(If you want a minimum with no maximum, i.e., you want all words that appear at least 250 times with no upper limit, drag the maximum slider all the way to the right and it will say "All" instead of a number.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once we've set up our frequency options, we click the blue "Create List" link below the frequency sliders.  The grid at the bottom will populate with all the words that meet the criteria you set.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-createlist.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Here you can see that there are 97 words in the New Testament which appear exactly 9 times.  You can scroll through the list to see all the words.  You can also delete individual words from the list by clicking on the red trash can to the right of each line.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can clear the entire list by clicking the "Clear List" link.  You can also change your criteria and click "Create List" again to recreate the list.  But note that every time you click "Create List", a new list is created which overwrites the old list.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have the list you want, click the blue "Save" link in the upper right.  This will open up the "Save" dialog where you will give the group a name and decide if you want to split the words into multiple groups to make studying more manageable.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In this case, I've titled this new group "All Words appearing 9 times".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-savedlg-title.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Below the Name field, you can choose to split all these words into multiple groups.  As you can see, if you hit the "Create" button now, it will create one group of all 97 words.  But if you slide the scrollbar over, you can create more groups of fewer words.  As you slide the scrollbar, you'll see how many groups you can create and how many words would be in each group.  We could, if we wanted, create 97 groups each containing only one word.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-savedlg-oneword.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Let's create two groups so that each has half the words.  This way we don't have to study all 97 words at the same time.  We can study one group or the other.  And of course, we can always enable both groups to study all 97 words whenever we want.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-savedlg-twogroups.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you've chosen to create more than one group, the "Split Groups By" dropdown menu will become enabled.  Click where it says "Click Here" to select how you want the words assigned to groups.  You can create your groups splitting them alphabetically, by count (the number of times the word appears in the selection), or randomly.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-savedlg-random.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you've selected how to split the groups (if you are creating more than one group), click the "Create" button and the group(s) will be created.  The new group(s) you created will be at the bottom of the list.  If you created multiple groups, then each group will have a number appended to the name.  So the two groups we created are called "All words appearing 9 times-01" and "All words appearing 9 times-02".  Of course, you can click the "Edit" button and rename and/or reorder these groups as you like.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-newlistcreated.png"></p>
<h3>Create Groups Based on Chapters</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Another option for creating vocabulary lists is to create a list of words in a book, but order them by chapter first.  Imagine that you want to study the vocabulary in the book of Titus.  You would like to study all the words found in chapter 1 first, then all the new words found in chapter 2 which you haven't studied yet, and then finally all the new words in chapter 3 which you haven't studied yet. In order to create such a list, you first need to get all the words from any particular book. You must select a single book, and ALL the chapters.  You can, however, choose anything from the "Word Types" menu.  In the following image we are selecting all words in the book of Titus.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-allwords-titus.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now after clicking the Save button to bring up the "Save" dialog, the checkbox labeled "Create lists by chapters" will be enabled and you can click on it.  When you do, it will automatically fill in the name of the book you selected.  You cannot change this title.  In the image below, we have enabled this option.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-enablechapters.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now you need to use the slider to decide the maximum number of words you want in each group, and then choose how you want the words assigned in groups.  Below we have chosen to make groups of 50 words (maximum) and assign them to groups randomly.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-bychapters-options.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>After pressing the "Create" button, the program will create these groups by chapter.  This will take much more time than creating other groups because the program has to go through the lists pulling out the words for each chapter.  Here you can see that there are 144 words in chapter 1 and so we have three groups.  There are 71 words in chapter 2 which were not in chapter 1, and there are 84 words in chapter 3 which are not in either chapter 1 or 2.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-bychapters-groups.png"></p>
<h3>Create Group of Individual Words</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>You can also create a vocabulary group of any words you choose.  There are two ways to specify which words you include in a vocabulary group.  You can either select them from the Search or Details screens, or you can type (or paste) words in yourself.  Here we will look at how to type words in directly.  See the Search and Details sections below for information on how to add words to a Vocabulary group from those screens.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>To create a new group based on words we enter ourselves, then in the Vocabulary Groups screen click on "Edit", then click the plus sign ("+") to create a new list.  Then click on the "Manual List" button near the top of the screen.  Now your screen will look like this.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-import.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can type directly into this large "import" field that has the "Gr" symbol in it.  The "Gr" means that your keyboard will type in Greek letters.  You can see which English letters correspond to which Greek letters by pressing the dollar sign ("$").  This will bring up the Greek to English keyboard map.  Click anywhere on the keyboard map to close it.  <i>(On Desktop versions you can also press the spacebar to close the keyboard map.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-map.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you want to type a dollar sign itself ("$") in the import field, then on desktop simply type the dollar sign twice.  The first time will show the keyboard map but the second will hide the map and print a "$" in the field.  If you are on a mobile device, you'll need to switch to the English keyboard to type the "$".  <i>(See the section below on <b>Adding Special Entries</b> for how to switch between English and Greek keyboards.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>When entering words, you do not need to type any diacritics; the program will search for words without any diacritics.  But as you can see, you can type diacritics if you want to.  <i>(See the section on <b>Adding Special Entries</b> for times you may want to type Greek words with diacritics.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below we have typed in "καλος" and "αγαθος" which are the two common Greek words "καλός" and "ἀγαθός" but without any diacritics.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-import-typewords.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have typed in your words, click the "Add Words" link below the field.  The program will search for Greek words which match what you have entered and, assuming it finds them, will populate the list with these words, removing them from the import field where you typed them.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-import-addwords.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can continue entering and adding words to your list this way.  Unlike the "Create List" link, the "Add Words" link will not overwrite the exiting list.  It will add new words to the list.  <i>(It will not, however, add the same word multiple times.  Duplicates will be silently ignored.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If the program cannot find a word that matches what you typed, then you will be notified and that line will be left in the import field so you can edit it and try again.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-bad-entry.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If, on the other hand, a word you typed has multiple possible Greek words, all the words will be added and you will be notified so you can delete the words you do not want.  For example, if you enter "εις", that could be the Greek number "εἷς" ("one") or the preposition "είς" ("into").  Both will added to your list and you can scroll down and delete the one you do not want.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-multiples.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-add-multiples.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can also paste words into the import field rather than type them yourself.  <i>(If you have exported a group of words, you can paste that list of words into this field to add them to this new group.)</i>  Words can be pasted in with or without diacritics.  <i>(If you are on a desktop, you can right-click the field to bring up an "Open File" dialog where you can select a file.  The text of the file will be placed in the import field.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you copy in words with diacritics, the program will first search for the words as you entered them.  Then it will strip off all the diacritics and search for the word again.  In this way, hopefully, even if the list you are copying does not use the same Unicode encodings as the program does, you can still copy and paste words into the program and it will correctly identify them.  If it does not, and you are sure the word is spelled correctly, try replacing any letter including diacritics with the simple letter itself.  So if you copy in ἔμπροσθεν and the program can't recognize it, change the ἔ to a simple ε and try again.  The same goes for capitals.  If the program cannot recognize Ἀθῆναι (Athens), change the initial Ἀ into α (and change the ῆ into η) and try again.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you are working on a desktop, then you can copy and paste straight into the import field.  But if you are on mobile, then you cannot paste directly into the field.  Instead, press the "@" key.  This will bring up a mobile text field that you can paste into.  When you click OK, the lines will be transferred to the import field.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-paste.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click the "Add Words" link to verify these words and add them to your list.  Once you have entered all the words you wish for this vocabulary group, then click the "Save" link in the upper right to create the list containing these words.  You'll be taken to the Save dialog to give this new group a name as well as split it into multiple groups if prefer.</p>
<h3>Adding Special Entries</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>The import field also has one other "special" ability.  It allows you to create vocabulary entries which do not match dictionary words.  Right now, we have only added dictionary words, and the program automatically fills in the definition, word count, etc.  But many vocabulary lists want you to study irregular forms.  So there will be an entry for "ἦλθον" which is the aorist of "ἔρχομαι".  In order to enter a form which is not a dictionary word, you use a special syntax in the import field.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>You need to make three separate entries, each separated by "::".  The first entry is the dictionary word you want to associate this entry with.  The second is the entry you wish to create, and the third is the "definition" you want associated with this entry.  So in our example above, to create an entry for "ἦλθον" we would enter</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-import-special.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>When you click the "Add Words" link, you will see the entry in the grid does not have the dictionary entry for "ἔρχομαι" but rather the "entry" and "definition" which you created separated by "::".  When you click the "Save" link, this will create the entry "ἦλθον" with the definition "aorist of ἔρχομαι".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-special-added.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The dictionary word (the first entry) does not need to contain diacritics since the program will search for it with or without them.  The two other entries can be anything you want, so make sure that they appear the way you want.  The program does no checking on entries you create yourself.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In order to type this line, you may wish to include diacritics in your Greek word, and you may want to type in English to add descriptions.  You can add diacritics to vowels using special "control characters", "[ ( ] ) / 1 \ 2 = 3". <i>(Remember that pressing the dollar sign ("$") will bring up the keyboard map which shows these diacritics.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can type breathings, "[" or "(" for rough and "]" or ")" for smooth, and accents, "/" or "1" for acute, "\" or "2" for grave, and "=" or "3" for circumflex in front of any vowel.  So if you want an omega with a smooth breathing and a circumflex accent, you would type ")=w". (Or "]=w" or ")3w" or "]3w"; all create the same accented character.  Type whichever is easier on your keyboard.)  The order of the diacritics does not matter.  You could type "=]w" and get the same result.  Just be sure to type the letter last, after any control characters.  Nothing will appear until after you type the vowel at which point the character "<b>ὦ</b>" will appear.  The control characters do not appear when you type.  If you type anything other than a vowel immediately after these characters, then they will silently discarded.  If you want to type any of the control characters and have it appear, type a space (" ") immediately after the character.  So "( " will type "(", "3 " will type "3", etc.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can also switch your keyboard back to type in English (or whatever your native keyboard language is) by pressing the ampersand key ("&").  <i>(Desktop versions can also press the Tab key.)</i>  Pressing the "&" key repeatedly toggles the keyboard back and forth between Greek and English.  The keyboard language will be displayed in the watermark of the import field, "Gr" for Greek and "En" for English.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-import-english.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can cancel the creation of a new group at any time by clicking the "back" arrow in the upper left.  This will return you to the vocabulary groups screen.  Any words you have entered yourself and any lists of words you have created will remain here.  So you can leave this screen and return to it later and all your work will be saved.</p>
<h3>Editing Vocabulary Groups</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have created a vocabulary group, you can add and delete words in this group by clicking on the link which says "Examine X Words" where "X" tells you the number of words the list contains.  If you look at the two new groups we created earlier called "Words appearing 9 times-01" and "Words appearing 9 times-02", you'll see that they contain 49 and 48 words respectively.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-viewwords.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the "Examine" link for the first group will show you all the words which are in this group listed alphabetically.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-showall.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Here you see all the words in this vocabulary group along with their definitions, how many times that word appears in the entire New Testament, and (most importantly for this screen) when we will next see this word when we are reviewing this group.  By default, all words in a group are set to "Next Review" is "NOW".  But as you review vocabulary words, you will decide when you next want to see each word depending on how well you know it.  <i>(See the following section on Reviewing Vocabulary Words.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>So in the image above, you can see that the word ἄβυσσος will not be reviewed again until May 30, 2023, Ἀδάμ will not be reviewed again until June 1, 2023, and so on.  αἵρεσις, on the other hand, will be reviewed again the next time you review the words in this group because its Next Review date is "NOW".</p>
<p spacebelow=10>The "Edit" link will put this list into EDIT mode just like on the other screens.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-showall-edit.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>EDIT mode works similarly here as it does on the other screens.  You cannot, however reorder the words, nor can you export a single word.  The words in this screen are always in alphabetical order.  When you review words, they are always presented to you randomly.  And you cannot "rename" a word like you can a list or group.  Words can be added or deleted, but not renamed.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Like EDIT mode for other screens, clicking on the red adjust button will bring up the "Reset" and "Delete" buttons.  "Delete" will remove that word from this vocabulary group.  <i>(It never removes words from the database or from other groups; it only removes them from this group.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>"Reset" will reset the "Next Review" date to be "NOW".  In the following image you can see that we have "reset" the words ἄβυσσος and Ἀδάμ so they will be reviewed again the next time we study this group, and we have deleted the word ἄζυμος completely from the list.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-showall-reset.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can also add words to this vocabulary group by clicking the blue plus sign ("+") in the upper left.  This will bring up the same screen you saw previously when you created a new vocabulary group except that it only allows you to add words by entering them directly, not by selecting them by frequency.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below you see that we are adding words to the group "All words appearing 10 times" as that name appears at the top of the screen.  <i>(You cannot edit the name here; you edit group names in the Vocabulary Groups screen.)</i>  And the buttons to change between Frequency Lists and Manual Lists are grayed out because you cannot add words to an existing list by frequency.  You must create a new list to do that.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-addwords.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You enter new words here exactly as described above.  Once all the words you wish to add have been added to the grid in the lower half of the screen, click the "Save" link in the upper right.  Since you are adding words to an existing group, the program will not ask you for a group name or allow to split the words into multiple groups.  They will all be added to the group you are editing and you will be returned the group details screen.  <i>(Only new words will be added to the list.  If you try to add words that already exist in that list, they will be silently ignored.)</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>On a mobile device, the keyboard will cover much of the list of words at the bottom.  Click anywhere on the list of words to lower the keyboard so you can see the whole list.</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>When you are done editing the group, click the "Done" button to return to the normal Vocabulary Groups screen.</p>
