<p spacebelow=10>Drop-down menus for books and chapters (and verses) will use the entire height of the window rather than maxing out at 12 rows.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>A drop-down menu on the Occurrences page shows you how many times that word occurs in each book.  You can click on the header to sort by book or by occurrences.  Clicking on a book name takes you directly to the first listing for that book.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>On the Occurrence page, if a word (or form) appears multiple times in a verse, it will be noted next to the verse reference.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>The program remembers your previous choices for verb and noun reviews between restarts.</p>
