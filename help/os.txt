<p spacebelow=10>This program is available for all major computer operating systems: Android and iOS on Mobile; Windows, Macintosh, and Linux on Desktop.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can install any version of this software from the project's home page at <a href="https://claypotfrog.com">https://claypotfrog.com</a>.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have installed the app, mobile versions will update automatically as new versions are put up on the App store.  Desktop versions, however, will check for new updates each time they start up.  If the program finds a newer version is available than the one you are running, it will alert you.</p>

<p spacebelow=10>If you choose the top button, "Install This Version", then the program will download the appropriate installer for your Operating system from the Backup server and store it in your "Downloads" folder.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/upgrade_download.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you have checked the box marked "Download Only (Do not install)" then once the installer for the new version has been downloaded, the program will alert you but do nothing more.  You must manually install the program if you wish to use the new version.  (<i>Also please note that if you do not install the new version, then the next time the program starts it will again prompt you about the new version.</i>)</p>

<p spacebelow=10>If you do not check the "Download Only" box, then once the installer has been downloaded, the Greek Study App will close and the installer will begin automatically.  Follow the installer's prompt to install the new version.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you prefer not to install the new version now, you have two options for what to do instead.  If you click the middle button, "Remind Me Next Time", then the next time you start the program, it will again inform you of the new version with this same dialog box.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Or you can click the bottom button, "Ignore This Version."  In that case, the program will never alert you that this version is available.  If you change your mind later about installing it, you will need to <a href="https://claypotfrog.com">download it from the website</a> in order to install that version.  However, once the next sequential version is released, then the program will alert you again.  So if you choose to ignore version 2.9, once version 2.10 is released, you will be alerted so that you can install that version if you desire.</p>
