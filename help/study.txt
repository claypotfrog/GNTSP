<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the Forms icon brings up the list of major grammatical forms which you can review as well as a Verb Form Review you can use to test how well you recognize various verbal forms.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/studylist.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on any line other than the top line, Verb Forms Review, in this screen will bring up a list of grammatical forms for that part-of-speech.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/studytopic.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking any of these lines will expand the section so you can review the material.  Clicking in the section does nothing.  These lists are not interactive; they are only for review.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/studyclicked.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Like on the main About screen, you can close any section by pressing and holding until the section collapses back to just the title.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>On the main Forms screen, there is a blue gear icon in the upper-right.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/forms-settings-gear.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking this icon brings up the "Settings" menu for how noun cases are presented in the program.  You can choose to view nouns cases in the order: Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, Vocative (which I am told is the "American" order) or in the order: Nominative, Vocative, Accusative, Genitive, Dative (which I am told is the "British" order).</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/forms-settings.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>However you choose to view noun cases, they will be presented to you in this order everywhere that noun forms are displayed in the program, both here and on the Details screen. <i>(See the <b>Word Details</b> section later on this screen.)</i></p>

<h3>Verb Form Review</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the Verb Form Review line brings up the Verb Form Review screen where you can test your recognition of verbal forms.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verbreviewchooser.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the first drop-down, you choose whether you wish to review verbal forms (like in a textbook where all the forms are presented on one verb) or review forms found in the New Testament.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verbreviewchooseforms.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>After that, from the next drop-down you choose which types of verbs you wish to review.  If you have chosen to review the forms (like in a textbook), then you choose the verbs you wish to study: λύω (the standard Ω verb), ποιέω (an έω contract verb), δίδωμι (a common ΜΙ verb), etc.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verbreviewchoseverbs.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you have chosen to review verbs from the New Testament, then you choose which types of verbs: Ω verbs, contract verbs, ΜΙ verbs, etc.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verbreviewtype.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have chosen which verbs to study, click the appropriate buttons to select which various verb forms you wish to review.  You must choose at least one option from the TENSE, VOICE, and MOOD sections, but you can choose as many as you wish.  Not all options are available if those combinations don't exist in the Greek New Testament.  So if you choose only "Imperfect" from the TENSE section, then only "Indicative" will be available in the MOOD section because the "Imperfect" tense has only "Indicative" mood forms.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>Clicking the "Select All" button will select all the options in that group.</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the "Reset" link in the upper-right corner will turn off all the options and reset the dropdown menus back to the defaults.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the following image we have chosen to review Verbs from the New Testament - Present, Middle, Indicative forms of Non-Contract Omega verbs (so no μι verbs and no άω, έω, or όω verbs).</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verbreviewchoosen.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have chosen at least one option from the TENSE, VOICE, and MOOD sections, the "Study" button at the top of the screen will become active.  When you click on that button, a list of verbs meeting your criteria will be randomly selected from the database and displayed one at a time.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verbreviewshow.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Tap anywhere in the screen to see the information about this verbal form.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verbreviewshowall.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You see here the verb's parsing information, dictionary form, and dictionary definition.  The "Lookup" button will take you the Details page for this verb if you wish to examine it further.  You can return to the verb review page by clicking the "Forms" icon at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click on the back arrow in the upper-left hand corner to move backwards through the list of verbs.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>Please note that for the Present, Imperfect, Perfect, and Pluperfect tenses, the voice will be "mid/pass" rather than "middle" or "passive" since the middle and passive forms are the same in these tenses.</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can click away from the review at any time using the icons in the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.  Your progress is saved.  Clicking on the Forms icon will put you back where you were.  Click the "Exit" link at the top of the page to return to Verb Forms page where you can select new options.  Since the forms are randomly chosen from the database, simply pressing the "Study" link again will get you a new set of forms to test yourself with.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the blue Gear icon brings up the setting page for the verb form review.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/verbreviewsettings.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The top option controls how common a verb has to be in order to be included in your review of New Testament verbs.  <i>(This setting only matters when you are studying New Testament forms.)</i>  The higher you set this number, the more you limit which New Testament verbs you can review, but the more common will be the forms you see.  You can set this as low as 1, meaning all verbs in the Greek New Testament, or as high as 150, for which there are only 25 verbs in the New Testament which qualify.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>The lower option controls how many verbal forms you review in a session.  You can see between 5 and 100 verbs in each review.  You can drag both these sliders to a new position, or you can click on either side of the slider to move it by 1 in that direction.  Click the "Done" button to return to the selection screen.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><i>Please note that when you review verb forms, you will see all possible forms of that verb, regardless of whether that form exists in the New Testament.  If you are reviewing New Testament verbs, however, then you will only see forms which actually exist in the text.  For example, if you see "λύσω" in the verb form review, then the program will say that this could be two different forms of the verb.  It can be either the "future active indicative 1st person singular" or the "aorist active subjunctive 1st person singular".  But if you see "λύσω" in the New Testament verb review, then it will only say that this a "aorist active subjunctive 1st person singular" because the future form does not appear in the New Testament.</i></p>
