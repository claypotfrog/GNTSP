<p spacebelow=10>All the audio in this program was created using a "Text-To-Speech" AI which I trained on my voice reading Biblical Greek texts.  As such, all the words are spoken in <b>Erasmian</b> pronunciation.  Here's a chart of exactly how I pronounce each letter and letter combination.  Please note that there are differences of pronunciation within Erasmian, so this is not how everyone pronounces Erasmian.  This is how I pronounce Erasmian and how you will hear the words pronounced if you enable audio in the app.  (<i>See below for some of the other ways Erasmian is pronounced.</i>)</p>

<p spacebelow=10>There are a few combinations of two vowels which get pronounced together as one sound rather than pronouncing each vowel separately.  Two vowels pronounced as one sound is called a "diphthong".</p>

<h3>Erasmian Variations</h3>
<p spacebelow=5><b>ζ, Ζ (Zeta)</b>	I pronounce Zeta like the <b>z</b> in <b>z</b>oo, but some people pronounce it like the <b>dz</b> in ku<b>dz</b>u.</p>
<p spacebelow=5><b>ι, Ι (Iota)</b>	I always pronounce Iota like the <b>i</b> in sk<b>i</b>, but some people pronounce it like the <b>i</b> in s<b>i</b>t, and others pronounce it either way depending on where the Iota appears in the word.</p>
<p spacebelow=5><b>ρ, Ρ (Rho)</b>	I slightly roll the letter Rho like the rolled 'r' in Spanish or Italian.  But many English speakers simply use a regular English <b>r</b> as in <b>r</b>ope.</p>
<p spacebelow=5><b>υ, Υ (Upsilon)</b>	I pronounce Upsilon like the French 'u' or the German '&uuml;'  But many English speakers pronounce Upsilon like the 'οo' in m<b>oo</b>n.  However, 'υ' and 'ου' now sound the same.  As I say them, "λύω" (to untie) and "λούω" (to wash) do not sound the same.  If you pronounce 'υ' and 'ου' the same then those two words will sound identical.</p>
<p spacebelow=5>If you want to say the Upsilon like I do, it is not difficult to learn.  You say the sound <b>ee</b> as in g<b>ee</b>se, but round your lips.  Normally when you say 'ee', your lips are pulled back like you are smiling.  Now make the 'ee' sound, but pucker your lips like you are going to give someone a big kiss.  That's the Upsilon.</p>
<p spacebelow=5><b>χ, Χ (Chi)</b>	I pronounce the Chi like the German <b>ch</b> as in ba<b>ch</b> or the Hebrew <b>כ</b> (Kaf) as in מל<b>ך</b>.  Many English speakers simply pronounce it like a 'κ', but in that case, be aware that 'χ' and 'κ' now sound the same.</p>
<p spacebelow=5>If you want to say the Chi like I do, it is also fairly easy to learn.  Make the <b>k</b> sound like in <b>k</b>ey but don't totally stop the air for a moment like the 'k' does.  Just restrict the airflow; don't stop it.  It sounds to me a bit like a cat hissing from the back of its throat.</p>
<p spacebelow=5>The sound of 'χ' has the same relationship to the sound of 'k' as 's' does to 't'.  Say "tap" and "sap".  Do you hear/feel how when you say the 't', your tongue totally stops the air for a moment?  But when you say the 's', your tongue doesn't quite touch the top of your mouth to stop the air; it just gets close to the top and so restricts the air rather than stopping it.  Your tongue is in basically the same place in your mouth for both letters.  But for the 't', the airflow is stopped for a moment while for the 's', the airflow is just restricted.  That's what the 'χ' does.  Your tongue is almost making the sound of a 'k', but it just restricts the airflow rather than stopping it.</p>

<h3>'η' versus 'ει'</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>The difference between these two is, admittedly, so slight as to be virtually indistiguishable, but they are actually different.  The 'ει' sounds like the 'η' except that it has a slight 'y' sound at the end.  Like the "A" sound when you say the word "ray" versus the word "rate".  Do you hear how there is a slight 'y' sound at the end of the word "ray"?  (At least there is when I say it; you may say it differently.)  The 'ει' sounds like the <b>ay</b> in r<b>ay</b>, while the 'η' sounds like the <b>a</b> in r<b>a</b>te.  There's no little 'y' sound at the end of the 'η'.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>But the difference is so slight and almost impossbile to hear when you are speaking normally.  Even in my own recordings I can't necessarily hear the difference.  But if you want to make the two sounds like I do, then practice putting that <i>very slight</i> 'y' sound at the end of 'ει' and not putting it at the end of 'η'.</p>

<h3>Why I Have Used Erasmian Pronunciation In This App</h3>
<p spacebelow=10><i>Please note that this is entirely my opinion, and you are welcome to disagree with me.  And as noted in the <b>Audio</b> section of the "Help" page, you can turn off audio everywhere in the app.  Its use is totally optional.</i></p>
<p spacebelow=10>There are many ways to pronounce Koine Greek in use today: Reconstructed Classical, Reconstructed Koine, Erasmian, and Modern being the main ones.  And there are differences even within each pronunciation system.  Erasmian was certainly NOT how anyone in Ancient Greece or the Roman Empire ever spoke Greek.  It is a pronunciation system made up by the Dutch Monk Desiderius Erasmus (hence the name) in the early 16th century.  But it does have one advantage (in my opinion) over the other systems when it comes to learning Koine Greek.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In Erasmian (at least as I learned it), all the letters and letter combinations make unique sounds.  That's not true with the other pronunciations.  So in Erasmian, words that sound different are spelled different, and words that sound the same are spelled the same.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>For example, in Erasmian, the "eye" sound is always spelled "αι", "αι" is always pronounced as "eye", and nothing else makes the sound "eye".  The "oh" sound is always spelled "ω", "ω" is always pronounced as "oh", and nothing else makes the sound "oh".  So if you heard "eye-own" in Greek, there's only one way to spell that in Erasmian, "αἰων".  No other letters make those sounds.  I find that very helpful for learning vocabulary and for comprehension when reading aloud.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>But again, all this is my totally subjective opinion.  There are very good reasons for learning a different pronunciation system.  I hear more and more Reconstructed Koine among New Testament scholars, so you may want to learn that system if you are planning to pursue advanced degrees in New Testament studies.  Or if you plan to go on and study Classical Greek as well as Koine, then perhaps you should learn Reconstructed Classical.  If you already know or plan to learn Modern Greek, then Modern pronunciation may be best for you.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>But if you just want to learn Koine Greek, then in my opinion, the distinct sounds made in the Erasmian system make it the easiest pronunciation method for learning vocabulary and spelling.  Except for double letters (like the double 'λ' in "ἀλλά" or the double 'σ' in "θάλασσα") or (unless spoken very slowly) 'η' vs. 'ει', you can confidently spell every word you hear.  If, however, you really want to hear another pronuncation in the app, please contact me (see the "Contacts" section on the About page), and I'll send you instructions for how to make recordings which I can use to produce audio using your preferred pronunciation.  But be aware that it requires recording thousands of words.</p>
