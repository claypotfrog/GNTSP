<h3>Renaming a Vocabulary List and Group</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>On either the Vocabulary List screen or the Vocabulary Groups screen, you can rename any of the lists or groups.  First click on "Edit" in the upper right corner to put the lists into EDIT mode.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-edit.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>While in EDIT mode, click on any title to rename it.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-rename.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can also click and drag any line's reorder bars (the three gray horizontal lines on the right side) to reorder the list on this screen.  In the image below, we have dragged the first line of the list, "All Words by Frequency", to make it the second line of the list.  (<i>On Android you cannot click and drag the reorder bars directly.  First click on the bars of the row you wish to reorder.  This will put that row into "reorder" mode.  Then you can click anywhere on that row and drag it to a new position.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-reorder.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>While in EDIT mode, clicking on the red half circle on the left side will bring up more options for that list.  In the image below we have clicked on the icon on the second line, "All Verbs by Frequency", which brings up the "Share", "Export", "Reset", and "Delete" buttons for that list.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-parentlist-showoptions.png"></p>
<h3>Sharing a Vocabulary List or Group</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>See the section in the About page entitled "Sharing Vocabulary" for information how to share vocabulary lists with others using the program.</p>
<h3>Exporting a Vocabulary List or Group</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>See the section in the About page entitled "Exporting Vocabulary" for information how to export the data from a vocabulary list.</p>
<h3>Resetting a Vocabulary List or Group</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the blue "Reset" button will reset all the words in that vocabulary list or group so that you will review them again immediately the next time you review any words from this list.  If you do this for a vocabulary group, then only that group is reset.  If you do this for a vocabulary list, then all the groups in the list are reset.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-reset.png"></p>
<h3>Deleting a List or Group</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>Clicking on the red "Delete" button will delete this vocabulary list or group.  Once deleted, a list cannot be recovered.  (<i>If you have shared a vocabulary list or group, however, then you can re-import it.  See the section on "Sharing Vocabulary" on the About page for information how to share vocabulary lists.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Click anywhere else in order to return to the normal EDIT mode screen.</p>
<h3>Editing Vocabulary Groups</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>After you have created a vocabulary group (see the section on "Creating Vocabulary" on the About page), you can examine all the words in the group as well as add new words or delete existing words.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can examine the words in the group by clicking on the blue link for that group which says "Examine X Words" where "X" tells you the number of words the list contains.  Here we are looking at the groups we created in the "Creating Vocabulary" section which includes all the words in the gospel of Mark which appear less than 10 times in the entire Greek New Testament.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-mark-groups.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If we click on the link which says "Examine 41 Words" from the first group, "Mark Chp. 1", it takes us to a page where we see all the words which are part of this group.  (These words are listed in Alphabetical order the first time you enter this page.  But you can click on the blue line which says "Greek Word ascending" next to the label "Sort Results by" to see a drop-down menu to change the order of the lines.  Whatever you choose will remain the order every time you examine the words of a vocabulary group until you change it using the menu or close the program.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-viewwords.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Here you see all the words in this vocabulary group along with their definitions, how many times that word appears in the Greek New Testament, and when we will next see this word when we are reviewing this group.  </p>
<b><i>Resetting a word</i></b>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image above, you can see that all three of these words will not be reviewed again until August 1, 2024.  And just as we saw above that we can reset Vocabulary lists and groups, here we can reset individual words.  So we click on the blue "Edit" link in the upper right to put the list into EDIT mode, and then we click on the red half-circle to show the options.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-details-options.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image above, we are looking at the options for the first word on our list.  We click the blue "Reset" button and you see that the "Next Review" date for the first word says "NOW".  This means that the next time we study this list, we will see this word.  (See the section "Reviewing Vocabulary" on the About page for information how the Next Review date works.)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-details-reset.png"></p>
<b><i>Deleting a word</i></b>
<p spacebelow=10>We can also delete a word from a group in the same way.  Let's click on the red half-circle to bring up the options, but this time we will click on the red "Delete" button.  Unless you have Vocabulary delete warnings turned off (see the section on "Vocabulary Warnings" on the About page), the program will ask you to confirm the deletion.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-details-delete.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once we confirm the deletion, we'll see that this word has been removed from our list.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-details-deleted.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Please note that deleting a word from a vocabulary groups only removes the word from <i>this</i> group.  It does not remove it from any other group, nor does it remove the word from the dictionary.</p>
<b><i>Adding new words</i></b>
<p spacebelow=10>There are two ways to add new words to an existing vocabulary group.  We can add them manually here, or we can add them from the word details page or the search page.</p>
<h3>Adding words manually</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>To manually add more words to this vocabulary group, click on the "Edit" link to put the list into EDIT mode, and then click the blue "+" ("plus") that appears on the upper left.  This take us to the Vocabulary Creator page.  This is the same page that we used to create Vocabulary groups in the first place.  But this time we are on the "Manual List" side rather than the "Frequency List" side (although you can click on the selection bar at the top and access either).</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-details-add.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can type words directly into this large "import" field that has the "Gr" symbol in it.  The "Gr" means that your keyboard will type in Greek letters.  You can see which English letters correspond to which Greek letters by pressing the dollar sign ("$").  This will bring up the Greek to English keyboard map.  Click anywhere on the keyboard map to close it.  (<i>On Desktop versions you can also press the spacebar to close the keyboard map.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-map.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>When entering words, you do not need to type any diacritics; the program will search for words without any diacritics.  But as you can see from the keyboard map, you can type diacritics if you want to.  (<i>See the section at the bottom of this page on <b>Adding Special Entries</b> for times you may want to type Greek words with diacritics.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In the image below we have typed in "καλος" and "αγαθος" which are the two common Greek words "καλός" and "ἀγαθός" but without any diacritics.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-import-typewords.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Once you have typed in your words, click the "Add Words" link below the field.  The program will search for Greek words which match what you have entered and, assuming it finds them, will populate the list with these words, removing them from the import field where you typed them.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-import-addwords.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can continue entering and adding words to your list this way.  Unlike the "Create List" link that you have when you on the Frequency List side, the "Add Words" link will not overwrite the exiting list.  It will add new words to the list.  (<i>It will not, however, add the same word multiple times.  Duplicates will be silently ignored.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>If the program cannot find a word that matches what you typed, then you will be notified and that line will be left in the import field so you can edit it and try again.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-bad-entry.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If, on the other hand, a word you typed has multiple possible Greek words, all the words will be added and you will be notified so you can delete the words you do not want.  For example, if you enter "εις", that could be the Greek number "εἷς" ("one") or the preposition "είς" ("into").  Both will added to your list and you can scroll down and delete the one you do not want.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-multiples.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-add-multiples.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If you do enter words with diacritics (or perhaps copy them in from somewhere), the program will first search for the words as you entered them.  Then it will strip off all the diacritics and search for the word again.  In this way, hopefully, even if the list you are copying does not use the same Unicode encodings as the program does, you can still copy and paste words into the program and it will correctly identify them.  If it does not, and you are sure the word is spelled correctly, try replacing any letter including diacritics with the simple letter itself.  So if you copy in ἔμπροσθεν (in front of), and the program can't recognize it, change the ἔ to a simple ε and try again.  The same goes for capitals.  If the program cannot recognize Ἀθῆναι (Athens), change the initial Ἀ into α (and change the ῆ into η) and try again.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>Let's imagine that we want to add back the word ἄγριος which we just deleted above.  If there are any entries in the list, then we first we press the blue "Clear List" link to remove them.  Then we enter "agrios" into the entry field.  The program will automatically convert those letters to the Greek versions as explained above.</p> 
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-details-add-agrios.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Then we click the blue "Add Words" link to insert that word into the list.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-details-agrios-added.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Finally we click the blue "Add" link in the upper right to add this word into the "Mark Chp. 1" vocabulary group.  The word is added and we are taken back to the details page for this group.  We can see the entry for "ἄγριος" is once again the first entry (assuming we are viewing the words alphabetically as we are here).</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-details-agrios-finished.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can cancel the adding of new words anytime by clicking the "back" arrow in the upper left.  This will return you to the details page for this vocabulary group without adding anything.  Any words you have entered yourself and any lists of words you have created will remain here.  So you can leave this screen and return to it later and all your work will be saved.</p>
<h3>Adding words from the Details and Search screens</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>In order to add words to a vocabulary group from the Details or Search screen, you first need to "star" that vocabulary group.  On the right side of every vocabulary group in the vocabulary groups screen, there is the blue outline of a star.  If you click on that icon, it will turn solid blue, and that vocabulary group is now "starred".  This means that you can add words directly to that group.  Here is our trusty "Mark" Vocabulary list that we created in the "Creating Vocabulary" section and we have been working with ever since.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-mark-all-chp.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Let's create a new empty group here that we will use to add new words.  Create an empty group as described in the "Creating Vocabulary" section of the About page, and then rename it "Cool Words in Mark".  So here's our Mark vocabulary list with the new group.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-coolmark.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now click this blue star outline for this group, and it will turn solid.  We have "starred" this group so we can add words directly to it.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-coolmark-starred.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>Now imagine as we are reading, we come across this word in Mark 1:43, "ἐμβριμάομαι", "to snort".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-snort.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>We <i>definitely</i> want to remember how to say "snort" in Koine Greek!  So we click the blue box to go the details page for this word.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-snort-details.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The last line of the details says "Add word to vocabulary".  If you click that line, you will see a drop-down menu of vocabulary lists you can add this word to.  The first line always says "Vocabulary Creator Field".  This is the manual entry field on the Vocabulary Creator page.  You can always add a word there and deal with it later.  But any vocabulary groups which you have "starred" will also appear in this menu.  Since we starred the group "Cool Words in Mark" group in the "Mark" vocabulary list, that group shows up in the menu.</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-details-add-menu.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>If we click that line, "Cool Words in Mark", then this word will automatically added to that group.  Now if we go back and look at our "Cool Words in Mark" vocabulary group, we see that it is no longer empty, but has one word in it - "ἐμβριμάομαι".
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-details-snort-added.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>We can also add words to groups from the Search page in the same manner.  When we choose to add a word (or words) from the search page to a vocabulary group, we will see this same drop-down menu.  Whichever group name we click on in that menu, the word(s) will be added to that group.  Please see the section "Searching" on the About page for more information and images of how to do this.</p>
<h3>Adding Special Entries</h3>
<p spacebelow=10>The import field on the Vocabulary Creator page also has one other "special" ability.  It allows you to create vocabulary entries which do not match dictionary words.  Right now, we have only added dictionary words, and the program automatically fills in the definition, word count, etc.  But many vocabulary lists want you to study irregular forms.  So there will be an entry for "ἦλθον" which is the aorist of "ἔρχομαι".  In order to enter a form which is not a dictionary word, you use a special syntax in the import field.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>You need to make three separate entries, each separated by "::".  The first entry is the dictionary word you want to associate this entry with.  The second is the entry you wish to create, and the third is the "definition" you want associated with this entry.  So in our example above, to create an entry for "ἦλθον" we would enter</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-import-special.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>When you click the "Add Words" link, you will see the entry in the grid does not have the dictionary entry for "ἔρχομαι" but rather the "entry" and "definition" which you created separated by "::".  When you click the "Save" link, this will create the entry "ἦλθον" with the definition "aorist of ἔρχομαι".</p>
<p spacebelow=10><img src="binfile:help/images/vocab-childlist-special-added.png"></p>
<p spacebelow=10>The dictionary word (the first entry) does not need to contain diacritics since the program will search for it with or without them.  The two other entries can be anything you want, so make sure that they appear the way you want.  The program does no checking on entries you create yourself.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>In order to type this line, you may wish to include diacritics in your Greek word, and you may want to type in English to add descriptions.  You can add diacritics to vowels using special "control characters", "[ ( ] ) / 1 \ 2 = 3". (<i>Remember that pressing the dollar sign ("$") will bring up the keyboard map which shows these diacritics.</i>)</p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can type breathings, "[" or "(" for rough and "]" or ")" for smooth, and accents, "/" or "1" for acute, "\" or "2" for grave, and "=" or "3" for circumflex in front of any vowel.  So if you want an omega with a smooth breathing and a circumflex accent, you would type ")=w". (Or "]=w" or ")3w" or "]3w"; all create the same accented character.  Type whichever is easier on your keyboard.)  The order of the diacritics does not matter.  You could type "=]w" and get the same result.  Just be sure to type the letter last, after any control characters.  Nothing will appear until after you type the vowel at which point the character "<b>ὦ</b>" will appear.  The control characters do not appear when you type.  If you type anything other than a vowel immediately after these characters, then they will silently discarded.  If you want to type any of the control characters and have it appear, type a space (" ") immediately after the character.  So "( " will type "(", "3 " will type "3", etc.</p>
<p spacebelow=10>You can also switch your keyboard back to type in English (or whatever your native keyboard language is) by pressing the ampersand key ("&").  (<i>Desktop versions can also press the Tab key.</i>)  Pressing the "&" key repeatedly toggles the keyboard back and forth between Greek and English.  The keyboard language will be displayed in the watermark of the import field, "Gr" for Greek and "En" for English.</p>
