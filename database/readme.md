This is the database in sqlite 3.0 format as well as an sql dump of the entire database if you wish to create it in some other format.  There is also the "updates.sql" file which is how we will update the database during version upgrades so that we don't clobber any changes that users have made to their own copy of the database.

You'll need to unzip the GSPNT.db.zip file in this directory locally to create the actual sqlite database file - GSPNT.db
