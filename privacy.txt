Privacy Statement

The Greek New Testament Study Project collects no data from the user and shares no data with anyone else.

Unless you choose to backup your data using the build-in Backup/Synchronize function, the program and data files exist on your device alone.  If you do choose to use the backup function, then your data is encrypted using a password stored only on your device and known only to you.  An encrypted copy of your data is then stored on a server on the internet.
